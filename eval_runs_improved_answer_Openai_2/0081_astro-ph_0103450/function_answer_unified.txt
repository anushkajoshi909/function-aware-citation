The current work extends previous methods for determining metallicity and age in galaxies by exploring the use of the rest-frame near-UV spectral region to lift the degeneracy between age and metallicity [Extends] (astro-ph/0103450). This extension is motivated by the need to address the age-metallicity degeneracy, a limitation in previous work that made it difficult to accurately determine the ages of galaxies [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103450).
