The development of lossy data compression algorithms in the paper compares [Compares] to previous work by Wyner and Ziv in 1989 and utilizes [Uses] methods from rate-distortion theory and pattern-matching algorithms, such as the Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) and the Lempel-Ziv algorithm (math/0103007). The paper builds upon these foundations to prove strengthened versions of Shannon's source coding theorem and analyze the performance of mismatched codebooks (math/0103007).
