The current understanding of neutrino mass scenarios is based on experiments like the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment, which has already excluded degenerate neutrino mass scenarios [Background] (hep-ph/0102319). The extension of experiments like GENIUS will allow to test almost all neutrino mass scenarios and probe beyond Standard Model physics, including SUSY predictions for neutralinos as cold dark matter [Extends] (hep-ph/0102319).
