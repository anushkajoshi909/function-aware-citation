Future research can extend the current understanding of the Church-Turing Theses in the context of general relativity theory by exploring the implications of Malament-Hogarth space-times on non-Turing computations [FutureWork] (gr-qc/0104023). This can lead to a deeper understanding of the theoretical limitations of future computers and deductive sciences in the context of classical general relativity theory [FutureWork] (gr-qc/0104023).
