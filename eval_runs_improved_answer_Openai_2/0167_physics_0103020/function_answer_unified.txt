The current work's understanding of electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves differs from previous thoughts in that it reveals a net balance of negative charge from trapped electrons and positive charge from passing electrons, and a lack of thermal screening [Compares] (physics/0103020). This reexamination was motivated by limitations in previous work, such as the incorrect assumption of only density depletion and the need for thermal screening [Motivation] (physics/0103020).
