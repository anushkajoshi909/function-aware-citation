The calculation of Higgs-boson contributions to rare B decays is motivated by the goal of improving our knowledge of CP violation in the B system [Motivation] (hep-ex/0101055). Understanding this calculation requires background information on the upgraded CDF and D0 detectors' capabilities in measuring rare decays of B mesons and searching for the Higgs boson [Background] (hep-ex/0101055).
