Future research could be motivated by the current study's inability to distinguish between vertical and horizontal line nodes in spin-triplet superconducting states [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104432). This limitation suggests exploring alternative methods or materials, such as examining the Fermi surface shape or finite temperature effects, to better understand the pairing models [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104432).
