The dynamic and adaptive method for domain decomposition in the parallel tree-code originates from astrophysics simulations [Background] (astro-ph/0104152), and it is used to achieve low computational costs by performing domain decomposition 'on the fly' and only retrieving remote data when needed, resulting in a parallelization overhead of less than 4% of the total CPU-time [Uses] (astro-ph/0104152).
