The unification of independence achieved through the hierarchy of freeness can be further developed by constructing sequences of noncommutative probability spaces that approximate the free product of states [Motivation] (math/0103031). This approach can be extended to address potential limitations by associating a cocommutative *-bialgebra with the m-free product of states, allowing for the unification of independence in quantum probability [Motivation] (math/0103031).
