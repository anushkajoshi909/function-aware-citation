The local energy-density functional method extends existing nuclear physics calculations by investigating differential observables such as odd-even mass differences and charge radii [Extends] (nucl-th/0101012). It uses conventional mean field Skyrme-HFB and relativistic Hartree-BCS calculations for comparison, incorporating a zero-range cutoff density-dependent pairing interaction [Uses] (nucl-th/0101012).
