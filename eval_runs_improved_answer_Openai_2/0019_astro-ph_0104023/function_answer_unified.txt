Future studies can extend the current work's method of analyzing galaxy correlation functions to better understand the implications of the measured pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion on galaxy biasing by applying the method developed in the PSCz survey to other datasets, such as the LCRS, and exploring different biasing models [Extends] (astro-ph/0104023). This can be further developed in the future by testing the standard assumption of Gaussian random field primordial density fluctuations using measurements of galaxy clustering and the cosmic microwave background [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103017).
