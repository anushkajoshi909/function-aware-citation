The general two-dimensional gravity model provides background information by elucidating the canonical form of the model and reviewing the general solution of the equations of motion in the massless case [Background] (gr-qc/0101033). The model is then used to understand the use of the effective action in reproducing known solutions, such as the Fisher and Roberts solutions, by obtaining the effective equations of motion and the corresponding effective action for a scalar field [Uses] (gr-qc/0101033).
