The limitations of current photon emission calculations in high-energy collisions motivate further research [Motivation] (hep-ph/0104015). Future work could involve QCD studies in two-photon interactions at future linear colliders, which would provide opportunities for precision measurements and improved understanding [FutureWork] (hep-ph/0101075).
