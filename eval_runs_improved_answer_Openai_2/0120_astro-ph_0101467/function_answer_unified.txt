The current work's approach to simulating X-ray surface brightness distribution builds upon existing methods by using simulations to predict the distribution from diffuse gas, and it extends these methods by examining numerical issues and the effects of non-gravitational heating [Extends] (astro-ph/0101467). The approach provides a more detailed understanding of the extra-galactic X-ray background by computing the distribution of surface brightness on the sky and its characteristic shape [Extends] (astro-ph/0101467).
