The effects of irradiation on planetary atmospheres, as described in the background of this study [Background], are compared to other models in terms of the impact of dust clouds on atmospheric structure and emergent spectrum [Compares] (astro-ph/0104262). The study's findings on the alteration of innermost atmospheric layers and planet-to-star brightness ratios are consistent with recently reported upper limit values [Compares] (astro-ph/0104262).
