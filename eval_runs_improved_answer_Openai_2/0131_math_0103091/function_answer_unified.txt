The background information that there are infinitely many primes and that the product of the first k primes has neighbors with all prime divisors beyond p_k [Background] (math/0103091) motivates the current work on Goldbach's Conjecture, as failure of the conjecture for some 2n contradicts the proven "Goldbach for Residues" mod m_k for some k, thus providing a strong motivation [Motivation] (math/0103091).
