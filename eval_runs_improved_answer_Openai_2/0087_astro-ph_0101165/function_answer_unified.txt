The results of this study on radiative shock waves compare to other works in that they highlight the dependence of cosmic ray spectra on magnetic field configurations and turbulence spectra at relativistic shock waves [Compares] (astro-ph/0104120). The findings suggest future research directions, such as exploring particle acceleration at incompressible flow discontinuities at boundaries of relativistic jets (astro-ph/0104120).
