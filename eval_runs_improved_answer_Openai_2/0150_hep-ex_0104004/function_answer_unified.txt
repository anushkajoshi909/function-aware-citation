The analysis of the X-ray source is motivated by the desire to understand the properties of black holes and accretion flows [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103431). The properties of the X-ray source are understood using methods such as X-ray timing and spectral observations, and monitoring programs that track the evolution of the thermal and power-law components in the X-ray spectrum [Uses] (astro-ph/0101396).
