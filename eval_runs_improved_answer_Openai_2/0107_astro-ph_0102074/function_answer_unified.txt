The physics of gas accretion in young stellar clusters is characterized by competitive accretion, where stars near the cluster center accrete more due to higher gas densities [Background] (astro-ph/0102074). This understanding informs the methods used to model accretion rates, such as using a tidal-lobe radius instead of the Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius in gas-dominated clusters, which is essential for accurately predicting the evolution of embedded clusters [Uses] (astro-ph/0102024).
