The proposal by Fuller & Shi provides background for the generation of gravitational waves during the formation of supermassive black holes by suggesting that the collapse of supermassive objects could be a source of these waves [Background] (astro-ph/0101022). The aspects of their model are used to argue for the strong generation of gravitational waves, which could be detected by the LISA antenna, thus supporting the idea that these waves could occur with a high rate similar to that of gamma-ray bursts [Uses] (astro-ph/0101022).
