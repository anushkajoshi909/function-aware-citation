The finding of a linear term in the dispersion relation motivates further study of Bose-Einstein condensation dynamics [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104051). This result compares to existing studies, such as the investigation of momentum transfer in trapped condensates, which also examines the dynamic response function and its role in characterizing the system's time evolution [Compares] (cond-mat/0104051).
