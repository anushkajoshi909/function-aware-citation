Measuring muon polarization in kaon decay processes is motivated by the potential to obtain valuable information on CP violation and new physics [Motivation] (hep-ex/0101003). Future research in this area could involve detailed examinations of muon polarization in various kaon decay processes, which could provide clean measurements of CKM parameters and probes of new physics [FutureWork] (hep-ex/0101003).
