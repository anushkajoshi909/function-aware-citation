The current work compares to previous research by presenting preliminary results for fermion-pair and photon-pair production in e+e- collisions on the full LEP2 data set, showing no statistically significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations [Compares] (hep-ex/0103039). It extends previous research by setting the most stringent lower limits to date on the low gravity effective Planck scale and constraining the scales of string models like TeV strings and D-branes [Extends] (hep-ex/0103039).
