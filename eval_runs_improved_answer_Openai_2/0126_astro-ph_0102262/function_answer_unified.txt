The study of R Coronae Borealis stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud is motivated by the unknown absolute luminosities of Galactic RCB stars, which can be determined using the LMC RCB stars [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102262). The MACHO project photometry database is used to discover new RCB stars and estimate the number of RCB stars in the Galaxy, with the database facilitating the identification of eight new RCB stars in the LMC [Uses] (astro-ph/0102262).
