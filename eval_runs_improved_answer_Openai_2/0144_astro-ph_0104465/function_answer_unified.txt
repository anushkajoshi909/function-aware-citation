The results of this study compare to previous models of the Milky Way by ruling out highly flattened dark matter halos if certain Galactic constants are met [Compares] (astro-ph/0104465). The findings suggest future research directions, such as investigating the effects of gaseous velocity dispersion on HI flaring constraints and refining estimates of dark matter density in the Galactic centre [Compares] (astro-ph/0104465).
