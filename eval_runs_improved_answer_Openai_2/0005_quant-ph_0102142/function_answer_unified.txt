The pseudo mode theory extends previous work by applying the Fano diagonalisation method to a system with atomic transitions coupled to discrete and continuum quasimodes [Extends] (quant-ph/0102142). It compares to other methods by enabling treatment of non-Markovian behavior via Markovian master equations for the atom-discrete quasimode system, and is equivalent to a case with two discrete quasimodes for a simple photonic band gap model [Compares] (quant-ph/0102142).
