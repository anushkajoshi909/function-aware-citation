The current work's approach to simulating X-ray surface brightness distribution compares to existing methods by predicting the distribution from diffuse gas and examining numerical issues such as resolution [Compares] (astro-ph/0101467). It extends existing methods by exploring the effect of non-gravitational heating on the distribution and using the characteristic shape of surface brightness as a probe of energy injection [Extends] (astro-ph/0101467).
