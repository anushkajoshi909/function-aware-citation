The current work extends previous studies on the stability of poloidal magnetic fields in accretion discs by numerically confirming the existence of the interchange instability and finding a global instability that transports angular momentum outward [Extends] (astro-ph/0103409). It compares with previous predictions from the shearing sheet model and finds agreement in the stabilization of discs with Keplerian rotation, while also arguing that the found instability is likely to be the main angular momentum transport mechanism in certain discs [Compares] (astro-ph/0103409).
