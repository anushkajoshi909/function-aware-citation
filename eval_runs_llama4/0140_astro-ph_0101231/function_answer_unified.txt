The current work is set against the background of expected high-precision measurements of cosmic ray nuclei fluxes, which may reveal new insights into cosmic ray propagation [Background] (astro-ph/0103043). It extends our understanding of cosmic ray propagation by proposing a method to test the Cen A model of highest energy cosmic rays using neutron events observed by the Southern Auger Observatory [Extends] (astro-ph/0103043).
