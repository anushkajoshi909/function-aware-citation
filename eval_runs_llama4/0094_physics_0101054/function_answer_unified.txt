The current work extends Einstein's introduction of coefficients of spontaneous and induced emission by reexamining it from the viewpoint of stochastic electrodynamics and deriving the Planck formula [Extends] (physics/0101054). This builds upon the background that Einstein's work has been regarded as a proof of quantum energy discreteness playing a crucial role in the derivation of Planck's blackbody radiation law [Background] (physics/0101054).
