The limitation of the semiclassical model of the collective atomic recoil laser in describing quantum effects motivated its extension to include the quantum mechanical description of the center-of-mass motion of atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate [Motivation] (cond-mat/0102360). This extension builds upon previous work by incorporating the Maxwell-Bloch equations for two momentum levels and introducing a collective parameter to describe the average number of photons scattered per atom [Extends] (cond-mat/0102360).
