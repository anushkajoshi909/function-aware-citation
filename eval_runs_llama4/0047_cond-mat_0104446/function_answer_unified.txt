Limitations in understanding the magnetic structure of CeRhIn$_{5}$ and Ce$_{2}$RhIn$_{8}$, particularly their anisotropic properties, motivate further research into their field-dependent heat capacity [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104446). Future work could explore the implications of their distinct magnetic behaviors, including the anisotropic spin-density wave and simple antiferromagnetic magnon behaviors [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104446).
