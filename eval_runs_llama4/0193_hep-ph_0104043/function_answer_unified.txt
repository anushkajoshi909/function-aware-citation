The current work is motivated by previous research, such as the discovery of decoupled resonances by Kuo et al., to develop a new approximate method for studying three flavor neutrino oscillations in matter [Motivation] (hep-ph/0104043). This method builds on a new theoretical framework for three neutrino mixing in matter, which was previously established and provided rigorous analytical solutions [Background] (hep-ph/0104043).
