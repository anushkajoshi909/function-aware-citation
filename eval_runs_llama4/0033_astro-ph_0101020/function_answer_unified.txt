The two-fluid model of diffusive shock acceleration provides background information for understanding the production of energetic cosmic rays by analyzing the acceleration of relativistic particles due to repeated scattering across a shock wave [Background] (astro-ph/0101020). This model is used to classify the parameter space of shock transitions and identify the most stable configuration, which is essential for understanding the production of energetic cosmic rays [Uses] (astro-ph/0101020).
