The current code's approach to solving the transfer of continuum and lines is compared to previous work in that it uses the Accelerated Lambda Iteration method and a two stream Eddington approximation, without the local escape probability formalism [Compares] (astro-ph/0103317). Understanding this comparison requires background information on radiative transfer and photoionized media, including the importance of density and pressure distribution [Background] (astro-ph/0103317).
