The effects of irradiation on planetary atmospheres, as described in the background of this study [Background] (astro-ph/0104262), are compared to other models in terms of the impact of dust clouds on atmospheric structure and emergent spectrum [Compares] (astro-ph/0104262). The study's models indicate that irradiated planets without dust opacity are brighter in the optical than dusty planets, consistent with recently reported upper limit values [Compares] (astro-ph/0104262).
