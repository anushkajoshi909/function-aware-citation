The current understanding of ionization properties in Damped Ly alpha systems is limited by the potential effects of ionization corrections on abundance measurements, which motivates further research [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104298). The background of this issue lies in the analysis of ionization properties and elemental abundances in Damped Ly alpha systems, where gas of intermediate ionization state plays a significant role [Background] (astro-ph/0104298).
