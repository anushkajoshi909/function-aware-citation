Future research can use the extended Emery model to improve understanding of copper-oxide layered materials by analyzing the three-band structure and its parameters, such as Cu-O site energy splitting and O-O second neighbor hopping [Extends] (cond-mat/0103057). This analysis can help relate the band touching and van Hove singularity to the appearance of superconducting properties in these materials [Extends] (cond-mat/0103057).
