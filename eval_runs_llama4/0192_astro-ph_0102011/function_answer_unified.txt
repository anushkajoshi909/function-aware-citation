The use of specific simulations in the study of disc-like objects is motivated by the need to accurately model the structural and dynamical properties of these objects, which can be achieved through the implementation of inefficient star formation algorithms [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102011). This approach is supported by the background of previous studies that have compared the properties of disc-like objects formed in hierarchical hydrodynamical simulations with observations of spiral galaxies, showing satisfactory agreement [Background] (astro-ph/0101490).
