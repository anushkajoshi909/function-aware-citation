The mid-infrared spectral energy distribution of Mrk 279 is characterized by a strong power law continuum and weak PAH emission features, similar to other Seyfert galaxies [Compares] (astro-ph/0101103), and its emission features are thought to be primarily due to dust heated directly by the central AGN [Background] (astro-ph/0102356). The mid-IR bump in Mrk 279's spectral energy distribution is consistent with thermal emission from dust grains at a distance of >= 100 light-days [Background] (astro-ph/0102356).
