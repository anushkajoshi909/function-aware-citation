The analysis of the cyclic group of units in Z_k can be extended to explore new areas of residue arithmetic by examining the properties of the subgroup of order p-1 and the concept of "carry" [Extends] (math/0103083). This extension can lead to future research in areas such as the additive structure of Z(.) mod m_k and the relationship between Goldbach's Conjecture and the properties of units in Z_{m_k} [FutureWork] (math/0103091).
