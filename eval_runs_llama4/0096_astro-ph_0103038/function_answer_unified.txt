The current work's approach to simulating relativistic jets compares to previous models by highlighting the importance of magnetic field configurations and turbulence spectra in shaping cosmic ray spectra, differing from non-relativistic shocks [Compares] (astro-ph/0104120). This difference suggests potential areas of future research, such as exploring particle acceleration at shear layers in relativistic jets [Compares] (astro-ph/0104120).
