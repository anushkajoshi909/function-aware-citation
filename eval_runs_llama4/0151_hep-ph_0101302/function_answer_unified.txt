The work extends previous lattice estimates by introducing a new approach to expand gauge-invariant Wilson operators on lattice [Extends] (hep-lat/0104007). This development motivates the need for high-order perturbative calculations in the context of the operator product expansion, as it overcomes shortcomings of former methods and enables expansion of any Wilson operators [Motivation] (hep-lat/0104007).
