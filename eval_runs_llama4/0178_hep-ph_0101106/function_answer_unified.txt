The current work on CP-violating phases can be extended by reexamining large phases in the general Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and exploring allowed configurations of phases and masses [Extends] (hep-ph/0101106). Future research directions can be explored by considering the measurement of CP-violating phases at a future linear collider and constructing CP-odd kinematical variables to unambiguously identify CP violation [FutureWork] (hep-ph/0101106).
