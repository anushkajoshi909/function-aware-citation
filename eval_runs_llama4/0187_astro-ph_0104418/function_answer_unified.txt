The methods used in the current work compare to those of previous redshift surveys in terms of their ability to understand large-scale structure in the Universe, building upon decades of progress since the late 1970s [Compares] (astro-ph/0104418), which has been driven by improvements in technologies, especially computing, and has involved various surveys, including the original CfA redshift survey and subsequent larger surveys [Background] (astro-ph/0104418).
