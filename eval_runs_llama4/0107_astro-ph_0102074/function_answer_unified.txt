The physics of gas accretion in young stellar clusters is a dynamic phenomenon where accretion rates are highly non-uniform, with stars nearer the centre of the cluster accreting more [Background] (astro-ph/0102074). This understanding of accretion rates informs the methods used to model them, such as using a tidal-lobe radius instead of the Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius in gas-dominated clusters, which is useful for studying the evolution of embedded clusters and the impact of gas removal on their survival [Uses] (astro-ph/0102024).
