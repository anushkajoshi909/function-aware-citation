The calculation of Higgs-boson contributions to rare B decays is motivated by the potential to improve our knowledge of CP violation in the B system [Motivation] (hep-ex/0101055). Understanding this calculation requires background information on the upgraded CDF and D0 detectors' capabilities in measuring rare B meson decays and searching for the Higgs boson in the 110-200 GeV mass range [Background] (hep-ex/0101055).
