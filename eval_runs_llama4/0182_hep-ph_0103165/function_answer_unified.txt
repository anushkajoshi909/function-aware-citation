Future research may utilize the developed techniques for analyzing SO(2N) invariant couplings to explore the generation of quark lepton textures and neutrino mass textures [FutureWork] (hep-ph/0103165). This could lead to a better understanding of proton decay lifetime and Higgs triplet textures [FutureWork] (hep-ph/0103165).
