The spectral analysis of the Vela pulsar [Compares] the observed effective temperature to standard neutron star cooling models, finding it to be lower than predicted (astro-ph/0103171). This analysis [Extends] our understanding of neutron star emission by providing a detailed characterization of the pulsar's spectrum, including a magnetic hydrogen atmosphere spectrum and a power-law component (astro-ph/0103171).
