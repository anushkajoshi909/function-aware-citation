The Migdal-Eliashberg theory has limitations, as evidenced by its incompatibility with experimental data of Rb$_3$C$_{60}$, which requires extremely large couplings that violate Migdal's theorem [Background] (cond-mat/0104457). This incompatibility motivates the need for future work in generalizing the theory of superconductivity to account for nonadiabatic regimes [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104457).
