The results of this study compare to previous models of the Milky Way by ruling out certain dark matter candidates and constraining Galactic constants [Compares] (astro-ph/0104465). The findings suggest future research directions, such as investigating the effects of gaseous velocity dispersion on dark matter halo shapes and refining estimates of Galactic constants [Compares] (astro-ph/0104465).
