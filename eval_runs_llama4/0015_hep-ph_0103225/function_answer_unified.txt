The study of the exclusive decay of heavy quarkonium is motivated by the potential to gain insight into how gluons are converted into pions and to study s-wave ππ scattering [Motivation] (hep-ph/0103225). Understanding this process requires background knowledge of non-relativistic QCD matrix elements and distribution amplitudes of two gluons in the isoscalar pion pair [Background] (hep-ph/0103225).
