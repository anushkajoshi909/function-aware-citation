The current study is motivated by the need to understand the dimensional crossover in Hubbard ladders, where the interactions and behavior change significantly above and below a certain crossover energy [Motivation] (cond-mat/0103159). Understanding this phenomenon requires background knowledge of the Hubbard model and its equivalence to a N-band model, as well as the use of renormalization group and bosonization techniques to study the spin and charge sectors [Background] (cond-mat/0103159).
