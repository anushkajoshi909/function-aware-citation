The use of statistical methods to study the correlation between radio and gamma-ray luminosities in blazars is motivated by the need to understand the association between superluminal ejections and gamma-ray flares [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102012). This motivation stems from observations suggesting a connection between the two phenomena, with statistical simulations indicating a high confidence level that the events are associated with each other [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102012).
