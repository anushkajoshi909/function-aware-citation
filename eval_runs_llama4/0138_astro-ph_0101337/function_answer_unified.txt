The current work is motivated by the need to investigate state transitions in black-hole candidates like GRO J1655-40 [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101305). Understanding this research requires background knowledge of optical spectroscopic studies and their relation to changes in the accretion flow geometry, which is associated with X-ray state transitions [Background] (astro-ph/0101305).
