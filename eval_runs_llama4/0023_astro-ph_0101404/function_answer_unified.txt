The limitations of the current study on the Tully-Fisher relation and dark matter halos motivate further research [Motivation] into the variation of the Tully-Fisher relation with redshift, which could be used to constrain galaxy-formation models (astro-ph/0102025). Future work could focus on breaking parameter degeneracies among galactosynthesis models and constraining the redshift distribution of collapsing dark-matter halos [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0102025).
