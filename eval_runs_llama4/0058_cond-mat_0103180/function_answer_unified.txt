The current work compares to previous research on the magnetic state of doped SrB$_{6}$ by investigating the effects of different impurities on the electronic structure [Compares] (cond-mat/0103180). It extends this research by providing a deeper understanding of the correlation between charge transfer and the size of the magnetic moment, particularly in the case of La-doping [Extends] (cond-mat/0103180).
