The revisitation of the OGLE database provides background information on the properties of Fourier parameters in different types of stars [Background] (astro-ph/0103498). This information is used to investigate the properties of Fourier parameters, allowing for the identification of clear separations among High-Amplitude Delta Scuti, RRc, and RRab stars, and the detection of candidate overtone pulsators [Uses] (astro-ph/0103498).
