The spectral energy distributions of Cen A and M87 provide background information for understanding their classification as high-energy-peaked BL Lac-like objects by revealing the peaks of their synchrotron emission [Background] (astro-ph/0102314). This knowledge extends our understanding of these objects' properties, including their potential Compton emission peaks and TeV gamma-ray fluxes, making them TeV gamma-ray source candidates [Extends] (astro-ph/0102314).
