The template spectra of normal galaxies along the Hubble sequence, as defined in this work, are comparable to previous studies in terms of observational approach, such as the use of homogeneous samples and accurate spectral classification [Compares] (astro-ph/0101416). The definition of these template spectra is based on observations of 28 local galaxies and is intended to provide a background for understanding the spectral properties of normal galaxies [Background] (astro-ph/0104427).
