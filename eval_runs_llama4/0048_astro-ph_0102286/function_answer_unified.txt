Future studies can extend the current classification schemes of early-type galaxies by incorporating the newly discovered intermediate class of galaxies, which have central cusp slopes and absolute magnitudes intermediate between those of core and power-law galaxies [Extends] (astro-ph/0102286). This extension is necessary as the existing schemes utilizing the extrapolated central cusp slope may be inadequate for galaxies with smoothly changing luminosity profile slopes [Extends] (astro-ph/0102286).
