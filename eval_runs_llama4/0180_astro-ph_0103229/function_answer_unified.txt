The current work's approach to investigating high energy radiation mechanisms compares to other studies by exploring the conditions under which different spectral components dominate [Compares] (astro-ph/0103229). The identification of different parameter space regions suggests future research directions, including the detection of inverse Compton and proton high energy components with future missions such as GLAST and Chandra [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103229).
