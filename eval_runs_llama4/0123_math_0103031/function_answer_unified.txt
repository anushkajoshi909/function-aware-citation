The unification of independence achieved through the hierarchy of freeness provides a foundation for addressing potential limitations in noncommutative probability theories [Background] (math/0103031). This approach can be further developed by extending the hierarchy to more general cases, such as conditionally free products of states, and associating cocommutative *-bialgebras with m-free products of states [Extends] (math/0103031).
