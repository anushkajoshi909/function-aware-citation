The extension of the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm to include surface fields [Extends] allows for a study of the capillary condensation critical point, which compares [Compares] favorably with the power laws predicted by Fisher and Nakanishi (cond-mat/0101198). The results of this study are consistent with these power laws, demonstrating the validity of the Fisher-Nakanishi scaling theory (cond-mat/0101198).
