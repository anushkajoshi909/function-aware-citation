The limitations of current understanding of close-in large planets, such as their unexpected existence near ordinary stars and uncertain composition, motivate further research into their properties [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101055). This motivation is grounded in the broader context of the theory of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets, which highlights the unique properties and behaviors of these objects [Background] (astro-ph/0103383).
