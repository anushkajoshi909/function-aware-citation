The detection of upper main sequence stars and red giant branch stars in the halo of an amorphous galaxy provides insight into the galaxy's history [Background] (astro-ph/0103121). This finding compares well with previous work on galaxy interactions, as the observed upper main sequence stars are likely the result of star formation triggered by the M81-NGC3077 tidal interaction, and the distance measurement agrees with estimates of other galaxies in the M81 Group [Compares] (astro-ph/0103121).
