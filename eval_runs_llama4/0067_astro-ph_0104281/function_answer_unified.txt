The X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 motivates the development of a two-phase model [Motivation] because its flat spectrum is among the flattest known for Seyferts, which favors the presence of two gas phases in pressure equilibrium (astro-ph/0104281). This spectrum compares to expected spectra for Seyfert galaxies in that X-ray spectra as flat as that of NGC 4151 are expected to favor a two-phase model [Compares] (astro-ph/0104281).
