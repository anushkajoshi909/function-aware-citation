The discovery of the 29 keV Cyclotron Resonant Scattering Feature in 4U 0352+309 [Background] provides new insights into the properties of X-ray pulsars, particularly those with low mass accretion rates, and was motivated by the need to understand the unusual X-ray spectrum of this persistent low luminosity Be/X-ray binary pulsar [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101110). The research uses established methods for spectral analysis, including continuum models and phase-resolved analysis, to characterize the cyclotron line energy and magnetic field strength (astro-ph/0101110).
