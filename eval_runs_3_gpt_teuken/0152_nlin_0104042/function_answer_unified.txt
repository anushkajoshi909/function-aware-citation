The study on the coexistence of two scaling regimes in shear dominated flows builds upon previous work by providing evidence of the coexistence of the classical Kolmogorov-like inertial range and the shear dominated range [Background] (nlin/0104042). The findings of this study motivate future research directions by allowing for a theoretical prediction of the scaling exponents of structure functions in the shear dominated range based on the known intermittency corrections for isotropic flows [Motivation] (nlin/0104042).
