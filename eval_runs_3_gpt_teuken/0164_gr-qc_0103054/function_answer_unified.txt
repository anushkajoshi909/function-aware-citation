The late-time behavior of a dynamically perturbed rapidly rotating black hole provides background for understanding its implications, as it exhibits a unique oscillating "tail" with an amplitude that decays as 1/t at late times [Background] (gr-qc/0103054), and this understanding motivates further research on gravitational-wave signals, particularly in constructing theoretical templates from linear combinations of many modes [Motivation] (gr-qc/0103054).
