The limitations of current gravitational lensing methods in predicting the maximum number of images produced by n-tuple lenses motivate further research into the gravitational lens equation and its implications for image production [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103463). This motivation stems from the need to better understand the relationship between n-tuple lenses and the maximum number of images they can produce, which is currently bounded by conflicting predictions [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103463).
