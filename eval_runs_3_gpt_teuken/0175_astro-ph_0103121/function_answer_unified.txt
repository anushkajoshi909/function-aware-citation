The detection of upper main sequence stars and red giant branch stars in the halo of an amorphous galaxy provides insight into the galaxy's history [Background] (astro-ph/0103121). This discovery is motivated by the desire to understand the relationship between galaxy interactions and distance measurements, as the observed stars are likely the result of star formation triggered by a tidal interaction [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103121).
