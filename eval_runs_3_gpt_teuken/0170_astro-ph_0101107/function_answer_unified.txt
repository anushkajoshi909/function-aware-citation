The current study's finding on the lower mass threshold for Hot Bottom Burning differs from existing stellar evolution models, which predict that stars with mass larger than 6 Mo experience a "normal" AGB evolution [Background] (astro-ph/0103104). Further research is needed to resolve the discrepancy between the observed and predicted luminosity of the carbon star, motivated by the importance of these stars as a source of primary carbon and nitrogen [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103104).
