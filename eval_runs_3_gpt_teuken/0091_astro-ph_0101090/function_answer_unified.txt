The observed radial velocity of the Local Interstellar Cloud is lower than previously predicted, suggesting compression or deceleration at its leading edge [Background] (astro-ph/0101090). The proposal to extend the Hyades Cloud boundary is motivated by previous observations of other stars in the vicinity and ground-based Ca II observations, indicating a need to reevaluate the cloud's boundaries [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101090).
