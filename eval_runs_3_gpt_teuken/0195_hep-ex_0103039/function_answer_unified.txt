The current work builds upon previous research on fermion-pair and photon-pair production in e+e- collisions, which has tested the Standard Model down to distances 10^{-19} - 10^{-20} m and set lower limits on new physics phenomena [Background] (hep-ex/0103039). The motivation for this work stems from hints of axial-vector contact interactions in previous data, which showed a 2.6 standard deviation deviation from the Standard Model expectation, suggesting an energy scale of around 10 TeV for contact interactions [Motivation] (hep-ph/0104165).
