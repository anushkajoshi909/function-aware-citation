The 2-3 symmetry provides a framework for understanding the neutrino mass matrix, motivating predictions such as maximum mixing in atmospheric neutrino oscillation and vanishing of the MNS matrix element $U_{e3}$ [Background] (hep-ph/0104116). This symmetry also extends our understanding by allowing for renormalization-group corrections and MSSM dynamics to generate deviations from these predictions at experimental energies [Background] (hep-ph/0104116).
