The background information on GaN/AlGaN quantum wells, including the re-ordered valence band and enhanced g-factor in magneto-luminescence spectra [Background] (cond-mat/0101069), motivates the current study on their valence band ordering and excitonic properties because it reveals unique properties that can be further explored [Motivation] (cond-mat/0101069).
