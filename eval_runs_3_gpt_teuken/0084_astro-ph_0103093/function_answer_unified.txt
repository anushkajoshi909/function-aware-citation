The method of multi-lens ray-tracing provides a foundation for understanding strong gravitational lensing by multiple objects [Background] (astro-ph/0103093). This method will be used in future research to improve our understanding of such phenomena, driven by the need to account for effects like external shear and aligned discs in lensing galaxies, which will be crucial for constraining lens models and statistical lensing [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103093).
