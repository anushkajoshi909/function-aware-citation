The current work's approach to simulating X-ray surface brightness distribution builds upon existing methods by using simulations to predict the distribution from diffuse gas [Background] (astro-ph/0101467), and is motivated by the need to better understand the extra-galactic X-ray background, which is tightly constrained by observational limits [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101467).
