The current work's approach to simulating relativistic jets differs from previous models in its consideration of magnetic field configurations and turbulence spectra, which can produce a wide range of cosmic ray spectra [Background] (astro-ph/0104120). The differences found suggest potential areas of future research, including the investigation of particle acceleration at shear layers in relativistic jets [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104120).
