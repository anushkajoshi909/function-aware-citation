The current study's methodology builds upon previous work, such as the cataloging by Braun & Burton [Background] (astro-ph/0103119), and extends it by providing a more detailed analysis of the warm neutral medium in compact high-velocity clouds, revealing a two-phase core/halo structure [Extends] (astro-ph/0103119).
