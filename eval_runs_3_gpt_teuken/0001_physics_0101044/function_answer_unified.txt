The methods used in this study can be applied to future research on parity nonconserving electric dipole transition amplitudes by utilizing the Dirac-Coulomb approximation and considering Breit corrections [Background] (physics/0101053). This approach can help improve the accuracy of calculations for other elements, extending the understanding of parity nonconserving phenomena [Extends] (physics/0101053).
