Current understanding of quantum communication and entanglement has limitations, such as the restricted ability to communicate classical information through quantum bits unless the parties are entangled [Background] (quant-ph/0101005). The potential to enhance classical communication efficiency motivates further research into quantum communication and entanglement, driven by the possibility of increasing information flux through communication channels using higher-dimensional entanglement [Motivation] (quant-ph/0104070).
