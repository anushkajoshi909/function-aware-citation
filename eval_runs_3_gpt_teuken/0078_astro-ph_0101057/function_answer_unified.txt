Further study of the X-ray sources in M33 could be motivated by the observed variability and complex spectral characteristics, such as the power-law or bremsstrahlung models for some sources and the disk-blackbody model for others [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101057). The unique properties of each source, like the hard spectrum of M33 X-9 and the potential binary companion of M33 X-8, could also guide future research [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101057).
