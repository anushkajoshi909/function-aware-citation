The background information on accretion disks in active galactic nuclei suggests that more complex models, such as the irradiated disk and disk-corona models, are required to explain the observed UV-X spectral distribution [Background] (astro-ph/0101203). This realization motivates future research to explore these complex models and alternative possibilities, such as the quasi-spherical distribution of dense clouds, to gain a deeper understanding of the accretion process [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101203).
