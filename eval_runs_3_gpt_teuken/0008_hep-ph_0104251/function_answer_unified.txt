The thesis extends the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model by exploring its generic version without imposed R-parity [Background] (hep-ph/0104276). It is motivated by the need to explain baryogenesis and cosmic rays through supersymmetric variants, which provide the necessary ingredients for a strong first-order phase transition and CP-violating processes [Motivation] (hep-ph/0102043).
