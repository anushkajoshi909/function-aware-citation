The relationship between sparsity and statistical independence in stochastic processes is not well understood, with existing knowledge indicating that these two measures of efficiency can have different optimal bases [Background] (math/0104083). Understanding this relationship is motivated by its importance in fields like data compression and computational neuroscience, where finding an efficient basis for representing input data streams is crucial [Motivation] (math/0104083).
