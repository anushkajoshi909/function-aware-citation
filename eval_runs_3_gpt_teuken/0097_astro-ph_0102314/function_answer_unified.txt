The spectral energy distributions of Cen A and M87 provide background information for understanding their classification as high-energy-peaked BL Lac-like objects [Background] (astro-ph/0102314), and their properties, such as synchrotron emission peaks, extend our knowledge of these objects [Extends] (astro-ph/0102314).
