The limitations of the current study on the Tully-Fisher relation and dark matter halos could motivate future research in areas such as galactosynthesis models and the variation of the Tully-Fisher relation with redshift [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102025). This research could potentially constrain the redshift distribution of collapsing dark-matter halos and the star-formation history [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102025).
