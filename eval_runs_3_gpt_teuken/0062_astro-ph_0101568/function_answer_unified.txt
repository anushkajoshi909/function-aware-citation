The work on the self-gravitating non-relativistic gas at thermal equilibrium is motivated by the differences between astrophysical systems and classical thermodynamical systems, particularly the effects of openness and gravity [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101265). This research builds upon previous studies by exploring the consequences of these differences for structure formation in astrophysical systems, providing new insights through N-body simulations [Background] (astro-ph/0101265).
