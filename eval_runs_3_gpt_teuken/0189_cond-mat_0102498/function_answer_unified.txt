The current work uses scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the microstructure of the MgB2 superconductor [Background] (cond-mat/0102312). It aims to solve the problem of understanding the superconducting properties of MgB2 by analyzing its conductance spectra, which is essential for determining the superconducting gap and its temperature dependence [Background] (cond-mat/0102312).
