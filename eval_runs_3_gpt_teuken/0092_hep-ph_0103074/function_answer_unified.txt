The current understanding of neutrino mass scenarios is based on experiments like the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment, which already excludes degenerate neutrino mass scenarios [Background] (hep-ph/0102319). The extension of experiments like GENIUS is motivated by the need to probe beyond Standard Model physics and test almost all neutrino mass scenarios, including degenerate and non-degenerate scenarios [Motivation] (hep-ph/0101148).
