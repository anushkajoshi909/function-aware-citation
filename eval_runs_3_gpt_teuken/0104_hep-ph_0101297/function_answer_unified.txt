The expansion of the Borel transform of a QCD amplitude near the infrared renormalon provides nontrivial constraints on the Borel amplitude, improving the accuracy of the ordinary perturbative expansion [Background] (hep-ph/0101297). This method extends current approaches by allowing for the prediction of higher-order coefficients and suggesting areas for future research, such as applying the improved Borel amplitude to other physical processes [Extends] (hep-ph/0101297).
