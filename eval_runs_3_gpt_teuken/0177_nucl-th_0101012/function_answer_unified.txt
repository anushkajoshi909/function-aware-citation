The local energy-density functional method builds upon existing nuclear physics calculations [Background] by using a zero-range cutoff density-dependent pairing interaction to investigate differential observables such as odd-even mass differences and charge radii (nucl-th/0101012). It extends these calculations [Extends] to reproduce the evolution of charge radii and nucleon separation energies, including kinks at magic neutron numbers, and compares the results with conventional mean field Skyrme-HFB and relativistic Hartree-BCS calculations (nucl-th/0101012).
