Studying KK graviton self-interactions at a future Graviton Factory can extend our understanding of the 5-d Randall-Sundrum model by probing the accuracy of the 5-d Einstein gravity picture [Motivation] (hep-ph/0104199). This can also suggest areas for future research, such as investigating higher derivative operators and mapping the 5-d fermion mass matrix [Motivation] (hep-ph/0104199).
