The current work's methods build upon previous redshift surveys, which have been essential for understanding large-scale structure in the Universe since the late 1970s [Background] (astro-ph/0104418). The current methods likely offer improved precision and capabilities compared to earlier surveys, such as the CfA redshift survey and others, which have collectively advanced our knowledge of cosmological flows and galaxy evolution [Background] (astro-ph/0104418).
