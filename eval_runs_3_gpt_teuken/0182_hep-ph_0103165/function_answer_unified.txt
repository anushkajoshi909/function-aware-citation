Future research may utilize the techniques developed for analyzing SO(2N) invariant couplings in the context of large tensor representations to further explore the generation of quark lepton textures and implications for neutrino mass textures [Background] (hep-ph/0103165). These techniques could also be applied to investigate other areas, such as proton decay lifetime, by analyzing the role of large tensor representations [Background] (hep-ph/0103165).
