The properties of SNe II-L and SNe IIn, which exhibit late-time interaction with circumstellar material and unusually dense circumstellar gas, respectively [Background] (astro-ph/0102485), motivate further study of these supernovae types to extend our understanding of supernovae and compare them to other types, such as SNe Ib and SNe Ic [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102485).
