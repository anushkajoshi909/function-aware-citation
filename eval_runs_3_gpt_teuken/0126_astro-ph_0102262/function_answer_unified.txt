The study of R Coronae Borealis stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud is motivated by the unknown absolute luminosities of Galactic RCB stars due to the lack of direct distance measurements [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102262). The MACHO project photometry database is utilized to discover new RCB stars, increasing the known number in the LMC to thirteen, which provides valuable insights into these stars [Background] (astro-ph/0102262).
