The background information about gravity and motion, which includes an interpretation of gravity as a pressure force and an equivalence principle between the absolute effects of motion and gravitation [Background] (gr-qc/0103025), motivates the development of preferred-frame theory as it aims to account for special relativity and provide a consistent celestial mechanics [Motivation] (gr-qc/0103025).
