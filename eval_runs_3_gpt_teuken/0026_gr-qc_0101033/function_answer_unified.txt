The general two-dimensional gravity model provides background information for understanding the use of the effective action [Background] by elucidating the canonical form of the model and reviewing the general solution of the equations of motion in the massless case (gr-qc/0101033). This background information is essential for reproducing known solutions, such as the Fisher and Roberts solutions, using the effective action [Background] (gr-qc/0101033).
