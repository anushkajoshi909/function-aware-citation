The physics of gas accretion in young stellar clusters is characterized by competitive accretion, where stars near the cluster center accrete more due to higher gas densities [Background] (astro-ph/0102074). Accretion rates in these clusters can be effectively modeled using either a tidal-lobe radius or Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius, depending on whether the gas or stars dominate the gravitational potential [Background] (astro-ph/0102074).
