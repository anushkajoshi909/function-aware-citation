The current work builds upon previous research on the magnetic state of doped SrB$_{6}$, which has shown that La-doping can lead to a weak ferromagnetic state due to a local modification of the electronic structure [Background] (cond-mat/0103180). The motivation for this study stems from the desire to understand the correlation between charge transfer and the size of the magnetic moment in doped SrB$_{6}$ [Motivation] (cond-mat/0103180).
