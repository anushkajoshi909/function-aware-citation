The current code's approach to solving the transfer of continuum and lines is based on a background of previous work, including the development of codes for optically thick and hot photoionized media [Background] (astro-ph/0103317). The motivation for this comparison comes from recent advances in numerical radiative transfer, which aim to help the molecular astrophysics community achieve new breakthroughs in interpreting spectroscopic observations [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102269).
