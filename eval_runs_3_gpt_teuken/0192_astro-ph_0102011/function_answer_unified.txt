The study of disc-like objects is grounded in the development of hierarchical hydrodynamical simulations that form and stabilize disk-like structures [Background] (astro-ph/0101490). The use of specific simulations, such as those implementing an inefficient Schmidt law-like algorithm for stellar formation, is motivated by their ability to produce disc-like objects with properties that agree with observations of spiral galaxies [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102011).
