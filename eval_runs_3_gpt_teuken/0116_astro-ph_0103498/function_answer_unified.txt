The revisitation of the OGLE database provides background information on the properties of Fourier parameters in different types of stars [Background] (astro-ph/0103498). The investigation is motivated by the need to understand the physical conditions in the stars involved and to identify clear separation criteria among High-Amplitude Delta Scuti, RRc, and RRab stars [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103498).
