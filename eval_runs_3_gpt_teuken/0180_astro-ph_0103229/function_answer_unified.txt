The current work's approach to investigating high energy radiation mechanisms provides a simple analytical framework to explore the conditions under which different spectral components dominate [Background] (astro-ph/0103229). The identification of distinct parameter space regions motivates future research directions, including the detection of inverse Compton and proton high energy components with missions like GLAST and Chandra [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103229).
