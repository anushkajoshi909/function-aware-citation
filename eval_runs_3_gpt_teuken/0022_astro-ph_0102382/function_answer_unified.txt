The current work extends our understanding of the Galactic Center by reviewing observational characteristics and accretion models related to the massive black hole [Background] (astro-ph/0102382), and it is motivated by the quest to understand the existence and activity of this black hole, which is of particular relevance due to its proximity and potential to reveal insights into extreme objects in galactic nuclei [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102382).
