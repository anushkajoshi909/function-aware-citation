The comparison of restricted N-body models with self-consistent N-body simulations informs future research on the interaction scenario between galaxies like NGC 4449 and DDO 125 by demonstrating the applicability of simple restricted N-body calculations [Background] (astro-ph/0104304), and motivating further investigation into the gravitational interaction between these galaxies, which is believed to have occurred around 4-6 billion years ago [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104304).
