The current work builds upon existing models by analyzing the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model with baryon and lepton number violation, providing a comprehensive understanding of its properties [Background] (hep-ph/0103005). It uses this analysis to study the renormalization group evolution and infrared stable fixed points of the model's Yukawa couplings and soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings, obtaining bounds on the baryon number violating coupling and soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings [Uses] (hep-ph/0103005).
