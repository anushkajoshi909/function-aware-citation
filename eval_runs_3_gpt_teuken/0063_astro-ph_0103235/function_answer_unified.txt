Beamed Magnetar Flares have distinct detection rates and characteristics compared to other gamma-ray bursts, with potential detection out to redshift z ~ 0.1 at a rate of ~ 100 yr^-1 [Background] (astro-ph/0103235). The possibility of beamed MFs accounting for short, hard Class II gamma-ray bursts motivates future research to explore this relationship and its implications for galaxy correlations [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103235).
