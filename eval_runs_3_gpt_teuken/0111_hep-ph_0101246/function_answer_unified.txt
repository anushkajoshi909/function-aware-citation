The limitations of current photon emission calculations in high-energy collisions could motivate future research in areas such as soft gluon summation and precision measurements [Background] (hep-ph/0104015). This research could lead to a better understanding of total cross-sections in photon-photon processes, particularly at low and high energy regions [Background] (hep-ph/0104015).
