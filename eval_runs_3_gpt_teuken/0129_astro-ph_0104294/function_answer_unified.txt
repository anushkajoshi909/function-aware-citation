The discovery of high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ sources motivates the study of chemically primitive galaxies in the early universe [Background] (astro-ph/0104308). This discovery extends our understanding of these galaxies by suggesting that damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems, which exhibit neutral Hydrogen column densities and metal abundances, could be the building blocks that merged to form normal galaxies [Extends] (astro-ph/0104308).
