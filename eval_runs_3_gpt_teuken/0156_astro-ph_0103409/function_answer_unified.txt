The current work builds upon previous studies on the stability of poloidal magnetic fields in accretion discs, confirming the existence of the interchange instability and exploring the effects of magnetic forces on disc stability [Background] (astro-ph/0103409). The research is motivated by the potential of this instability to be the main angular momentum transport mechanism in discs with strong poloidal magnetic fields, particularly in jet-producing discs [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103409).
