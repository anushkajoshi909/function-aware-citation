The problem of source crowding in astrometric measurements [Background] (astro-ph/0101217) motivates the development of new methods to reduce positional errors, as crowding can induce significant errors even for bright targets [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101217). Future work can focus on improving the accuracy of these measurements by utilizing spectral decomposition of fringe patterns and synthesis imaging with limited baseline orientations (astro-ph/0101217).
