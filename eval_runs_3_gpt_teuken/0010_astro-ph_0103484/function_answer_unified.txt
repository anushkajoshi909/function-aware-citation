The methods used in this study can inform future research on the X-ray luminosity of starburst galaxies by providing a framework for assessing the contribution of OB star populations to the total X-ray emission [Background] (astro-ph/0103484). This framework can be applied to other galaxies to better understand the relationship between star formation and X-ray luminosity, and to identify additional components that may be contributing to the observed emission [Background] (astro-ph/0103484).
