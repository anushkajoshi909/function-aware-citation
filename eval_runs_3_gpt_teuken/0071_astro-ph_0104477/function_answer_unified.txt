The spectroscopic survey of faint lensed galaxies in the core of the galaxy cluster AC114 builds upon the work of Natarajan et al by utilizing their gravitational lens model to select target galaxies and confirm predicted lensing redshifts [Background] (astro-ph/0104477). This survey motivates further research on the faint end of the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies, as it demonstrates a large gain in sensitivity towards low luminosity high-z objects and has the potential to constrain the faint end of the luminosity function when applied to an ensemble of massive cluster cores [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104477).
