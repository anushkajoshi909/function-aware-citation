The current work builds upon Einstein's introduction of coefficients of spontaneous and induced emission by reexamining his derivation of Planck's blackbody radiation law from the perspective of stochastic electrodynamics [Background] (physics/0101054). It utilizes this foundation to derive the Planck formula in a classical context, providing an alternative explanation for the energy discreteness [Extends] (physics/0101054).
