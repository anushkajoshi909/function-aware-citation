The properties of host galaxies of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars provide background information [Background] (astro-ph/0103238) on the origin of radio loudness, suggesting that radio-loud objects are powered by more massive black holes. This understanding motivates further research [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102046) into the relationship between quasar environments and radio luminosity, potentially revealing a correlation between the two.
