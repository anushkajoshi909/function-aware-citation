The new self-interaction correction method builds upon existing density functional theory methods by improving upon the commonly applied self interaction correction, which does not fully remove self interaction [Background] (cond-mat/0103324). It utilizes these methods by comparing its results to those obtained using the local density approximation and an atomic Hartree-Fock calculation, demonstrating improved accuracy [Background] (cond-mat/0103324).
