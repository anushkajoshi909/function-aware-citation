The current study extends our understanding of the relationship between mass-loss rates and crystalline silicate features in AGB stars, building on the background knowledge that ISO observations have shown crystalline silicate features are only present in O-rich AGB stars with high mass-loss rates [Background] (astro-ph/0101256). This research is motivated by the need to explain the lack of crystalline silicate features in low mass-loss rate AGB stars, which may actually form crystalline silicates without showing characteristic spectral features [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101256).
