The current work builds upon earlier research on cosmic microwave background anisotropies [Background] by utilizing datasets from experiments like the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) (astro-ph/0101086). The use of such datasets allows for the extension of previous studies by providing new constraints on parameterized models and examining model-independent constraints [Extends] (astro-ph/0101086).
