The current X-ray spectral analysis of Seyfert 2 galaxies builds upon previous work by deriving the basic spectral and timing properties of X-ray detected Seyfert galaxies [Background] (astro-ph/0101184), and the findings of similar photon indices in Seyfert 2 galaxies and narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, as well as indications of X-ray flux variations, motivate further investigation into the nature of these galaxies [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101184).
