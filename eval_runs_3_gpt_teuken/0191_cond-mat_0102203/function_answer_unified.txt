The experimental studies of discrete breathers in superconducting arrays, such as those in Josephson ladders, provide a foundation for potential future research in this area by demonstrating the detection and control of breather states [Background] (cond-mat/0102203). These studies also establish a basis for understanding the dynamics and resonances of discrete breathers through simple circuit models and simulations [Background] (cond-mat/0102203).
