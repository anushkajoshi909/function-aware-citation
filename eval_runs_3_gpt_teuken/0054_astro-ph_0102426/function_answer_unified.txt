Research on UHE neutrino scattering onto relic cosmic neutrinos provides background [Background] on how these interactions may overcome the GZK cut-off and offer insights into neutrino masses and relic densities (astro-ph/0102426). This potential to uncover new information motivates [Motivation] future studies in this area, as it could reveal unique characteristics of neutrino properties and relic densities (astro-ph/0102426).
