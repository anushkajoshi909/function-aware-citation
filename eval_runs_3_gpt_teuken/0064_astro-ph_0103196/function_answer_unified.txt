Current understanding of supernova explosions is limited by the lack of a proven scenario for the collapse and explosion of massive stars, with uncertainties in neutrino interactions and energy transport [Background] (astro-ph/0103015). Further research is motivated by the need to address challenges such as understanding the dynamics of young supernova remnants and inferring the nature of the supernova and its progenitor star from observations [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101043).
