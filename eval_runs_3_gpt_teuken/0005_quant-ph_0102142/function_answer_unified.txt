The pseudo mode theory extends previous work by applying the Fano diagonalisation method to a system with discrete and continuum quasimodes, allowing for the treatment of non-Markovian behavior in atomic systems [Background] (quant-ph/0102142). This approach compares to other methods by enabling the use of Markovian master equations for the atom-discrete quasimode system, even in cases of multiple excitation of the reservoir [Background] (quant-ph/0102142).
