The analysis of Higgs boson couplings in the 2HDM(II) model provides background [Background] for understanding the Standard Model-like scenario by comparing the SM and 2HDM(II) and deriving a relation between the ratios of couplings (hep-ph/0101208). This comparison motivates [Motivation] further research by highlighting the possibility of resolving SM-like scenarios via Higgs boson production at a Photon Collider, which can distinguish between the SM and 2HDM(II) (hep-ph/0101208).
