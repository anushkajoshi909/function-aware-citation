The study of Hercules X-1 in an anomalous low state provides background information on the behavior of X-ray binary systems, revealing a reflected spectrum largely uncontaminated by direct X-rays [Background] (astro-ph/0101417). This knowledge motivates further research into the characteristics of these systems, such as the behavior of accretion disks and companion stars, to better understand their complex interactions [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102100).
