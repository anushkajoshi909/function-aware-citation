VLBI's capability to image large fields-of-view with sub-mJy detection limits provides background [Background] for extending our understanding of cosmologically distant sources by distinguishing between starburst and AGN activity (astro-ph/0102037). This capability allows for the detection of faint radio sources, such as those in the Hubble Deep Field region, and sheds light on the co-existence of AGN and starburst activity in distant sources (astro-ph/0102037).
