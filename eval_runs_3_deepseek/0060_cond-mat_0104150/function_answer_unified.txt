The discovery of a gapped spectrum in Piperazinium Hexachlorodicuprate could motivate future research into frustrated quasi-two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104150). This motivation may lead to investigations of field-induced ordered phases and singlet-triplet excitation spectra in similar compounds [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104150).
