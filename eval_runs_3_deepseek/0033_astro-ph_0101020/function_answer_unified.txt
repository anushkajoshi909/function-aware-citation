The spectroscopic study of microlensed sources is motivated by the opportunity to study the kinematics of the Galactic bulge, extinction effects, and lens contributions [Background] (astro-ph/0101092). It uses datasets from spectrographic observations, such as those from the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph, and methods like template matching with Kurucz model spectra to derive radial velocities and extinctions [Background] (astro-ph/0101092).
