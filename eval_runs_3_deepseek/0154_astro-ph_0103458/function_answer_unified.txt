The current work uses near-infrared coronagraphic imaging to study the circumstellar disk around TW Hydrae [Uses] (astro-ph/0103458). It compares the derived disk properties to those of disks around classical T Tauri stars in more distant molecular clouds, finding similar characteristics [Compares] (astro-ph/0103458).
