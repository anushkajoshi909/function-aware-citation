The proposed model of stellar system formation compares favorably to existing observations of halo globular clusters, as the predicted characteristics of the formed stellar systems, such as size, velocity dispersion, and total stellar mass, match the observed properties of halo globular clusters [Compares] (astro-ph/0101197). Further research could validate this comparison by testing the model's predictions on the correlation between metallicity and galaxy type, as well as the expected trend of specific frequency with galaxy type [Compares] (astro-ph/0101197).
