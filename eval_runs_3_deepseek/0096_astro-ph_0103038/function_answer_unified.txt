The current work's approach to simulating relativistic jets compares to previous models by highlighting the importance of magnetic field configurations and turbulence spectra in shaping cosmic ray spectra, which can result in both flat and steep spectra (astro-ph/0104120). This comparison suggests potential areas of future research, such as exploring particle acceleration at shear layers at boundaries of relativistic jets [Compares] (astro-ph/0104120).
