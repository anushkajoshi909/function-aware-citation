The analysis of Higgs boson couplings in the 2HDM(II) model provides background [Background] on the Standard Model-like scenario, which can occur in the Standard Model as well as in other models, including the 2HDM (hep-ph/0101208). This analysis motivates further investigation and extends our understanding [Extends] of the scenario by deriving a pattern relation between the ratios of couplings and calculating loop couplings, allowing for differentiation between the SM and 2HDM(II) at a Photon Collider (hep-ph/0101208).
