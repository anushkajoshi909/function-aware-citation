The detection of upper main sequence stars and red giant branch stars in the halo of an amorphous galaxy provides insight into galaxy interactions [Background] (astro-ph/0103121). This discovery is motivated by the desire to understand the star formation triggered by tidal interactions, such as the M81-NGC3077 encounter, which is likely responsible for the observed young stars [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103121).
