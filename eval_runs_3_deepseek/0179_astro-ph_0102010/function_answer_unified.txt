The current work builds upon previous research on baryon fraction in clusters [Background] (astro-ph/0102010), and extends it by critically examining the baryon distribution in clusters to inform the estimation of the cosmological density parameter [Extends] (astro-ph/0102010), using the findings to argue that high values of the cosmological density parameter cannot be ruled out based on the baryon fraction argument [Uses] (astro-ph/0102010).
