The calculation of multi-loop master integrals was motivated by the need for a new method to solve the problem of high-precision calculation of these integrals [Motivation] (hep-ph/0102033). To understand this new approach, background information on integration-by-parts identities, factorial series, and Laplace's transformation is necessary, as these are used to construct and solve systems of difference equations [Background] (hep-ph/0102033).
