The current study's finding on the lower mass threshold for Hot Bottom Burning is lower than predicted by existing stellar evolution models, such as those presented in astro-ph/0103104, which suggest that models with mass larger than 6 Mo experience a "normal" AGB evolution [Compares] (astro-ph/0103104). Future research could resolve the discrepancy between the observed and predicted luminosity of the carbon star by further investigating the efficiency of the CNO cycle in the H-burning shell and the effects of thermal pulses on the convective envelope [Compares] (astro-ph/0103104).
