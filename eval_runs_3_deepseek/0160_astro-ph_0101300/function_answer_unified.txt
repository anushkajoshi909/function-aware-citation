The study of EUV emission in the Fornax cluster provides background information on the cluster's X-ray emitting gas and large radio source [Background] (astro-ph/0101300). It extends our understanding of cluster gas and radio sources by showing that the EUV emission is due to the low energy tail of the X-ray emitting gas, with no excess EUV emission detected at existing sensitivity levels [Extends] (astro-ph/0101300).
