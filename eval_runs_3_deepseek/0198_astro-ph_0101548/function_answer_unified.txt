The study of gas-phase abundances in the Magellanic Bridge is motivated by the presence of a unique region of gas between the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101548). The relative gas-phase abundances in the Magellanic Bridge are similar to those found in Galactic halo clouds, despite a significantly lower metallicity, with comparable column density ratios of higher ionization species [Compares] (astro-ph/0101548).
