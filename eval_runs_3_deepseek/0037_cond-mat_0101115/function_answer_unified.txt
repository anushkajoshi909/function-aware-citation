Molecular dynamics simulations of polyelectrolytes provide background information on their behavior in aqueous solutions by considering the phase behavior of polymeric systems [Background] (cond-mat/0101279). These simulations use specific methods, such as calculating structure factors beyond the Random Phase Approximation, to understand the complexation transition between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes [Background] (cond-mat/0101279).
