Future research could be motivated by the observed variability and spectral characteristics of the X-ray sources in M33, which suggest complex behaviors and possible binary companions [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101057). The variability and spectral shapes of these sources, such as the power-law or bremsstrahlung models and disk-blackbody models, could be further investigated to strengthen the idea that some of these sources are black holes accreting from binary companions [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101057).
