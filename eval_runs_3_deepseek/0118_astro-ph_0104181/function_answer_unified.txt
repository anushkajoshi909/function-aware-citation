The concept of homogeneity in cosmology is informed by previous results, such as the use of the trispectrum to differentiate between gaussian and non-gaussian models [Background] (astro-ph/0101143), and the analysis of scaling features in standard cosmologies suggests that the large-scale distribution of galaxies may follow a fractal pattern, motivating further investigation into the nature of homogeneity [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104181).
