The relationship between sparsity and statistical independence in stochastic processes [Compares] differs from existing knowledge on efficient data representation, which emphasizes the importance of finding a basis that can efficiently represent input data streams [Background] (math/0104083). This difference highlights the complexity of understanding the intricate relationship between sparsity and statistical independence [Compares] in the context of stochastic processes, particularly in fields like data compression and computational neuroscience [Background] (math/0104083).
