The current work builds upon previous research on the magnetic state of doped SrB$_{6}$, which has shown that La-doping can lead to a weak ferromagnetic state due to a local modification of the electronic structure [Background] (cond-mat/0103180). This previous research has established a correlation between charge transfer and the size of the magnetic moment, providing a foundation for further investigation [Background] (cond-mat/0103180).
