The limitations in understanding the magnetic structure of CeRhIn$_{5}$ and Ce$_{2}$RhIn$_{8}$, including their anisotropic properties and field-induced transitions, motivate further research into their field-dependent heat capacity [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104446). Future work could explore the implications of their distinct spin-density wave and magnon behaviors, particularly in relation to their two-dimensional magnetic structures [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104446).
