The current work's understanding of electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves differs from previous thoughts in that it reveals a net balance of negative charge from trapped electrons and positive charge from passing electrons, and a limitation in previous work that motivated this reexamination was the incorrect assumption that these waves consist only of density depletion [Compares] [Motivation] (physics/0103020).
