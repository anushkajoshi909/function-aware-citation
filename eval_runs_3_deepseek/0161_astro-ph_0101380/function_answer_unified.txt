The proposed model extends existing theories on blazar flares by incorporating additional radiation mechanisms such as Comptonization of light from the broad emission line region and IR radiation from hot dust [Extends] (astro-ph/0101380). It compares with observed flare behaviors by discussing the synchrotron-self Compton mechanism and its implications for X-ray production in blazars, as well as the energy dissipation and particle acceleration in sub-parsec jets [Compares] (astro-ph/0101382).
