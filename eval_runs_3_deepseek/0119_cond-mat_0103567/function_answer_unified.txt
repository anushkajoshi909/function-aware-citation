The current work's finding of a linear term in the dispersion relation is motivated by existing Bose-Einstein condensation studies, such as the investigation of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensed gas's response to a density perturbation [Background] (cond-mat/0104051). This finding compares to these studies by highlighting the importance of the dynamic response function in characterizing the time evolution of the system [Background] (cond-mat/0104051).
