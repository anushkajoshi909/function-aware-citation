The current work builds upon previous research on fermion-pair and photon-pair production in e+e- collisions, which has been extensively studied at LEP2, yielding no significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations [Background] (hep-ex/0103039). The current study extends this research by potentially providing new insights and more stringent limits on new physics phenomena, such as extra dimensions and low gravity effective Planck scale [Extends] (hep-ex/0103039).
