The proposed hybrid algorithm compares favorably to existing work in terms of efficiency, as it constructs an optimal deterministic hybrid algorithm and an efficient randomized hybrid algorithm [Compares] (cs/0101028). The background for this research is the study of on-line strategies for solving problems with hybrid algorithms, which involves running basic algorithms in disjoint memory areas and switching between them to solve a problem in the least amount of time [Background] (cs/0101028).
