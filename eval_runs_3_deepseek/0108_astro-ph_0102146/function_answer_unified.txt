The background information on accretion disks in active galactic nuclei suggests that future research directions should focus on developing more complex models, such as the irradiated disk and disk-corona models, to better explain the observed UV-X spectral distribution [Background] (astro-ph/0101203). These models may provide a framework for understanding the profile, intensity, and variability properties of the X-ray iron line, and alternative possibilities, such as a quasi-spherical distribution of dense clouds, should also be explored [Background] (astro-ph/0101203).
