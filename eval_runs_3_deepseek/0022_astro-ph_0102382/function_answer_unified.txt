The current work extends our understanding of the Galactic Center by reviewing observational characteristics and accretion models for the massive black hole coincident with Sgr A* [Extends] (astro-ph/0102382). It also compares with previous studies on the existence and activity of the massive black hole, showing that both black hole and fermion ball scenarios are consistent with the data, but future measurements could rule out one of the scenarios [Compares] (astro-ph/0103466).
