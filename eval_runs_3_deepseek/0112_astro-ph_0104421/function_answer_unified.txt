The study of the 5 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation in GRS 1739-278 extends our understanding of low-frequency QPOs by providing detailed insights into their properties and behavior [Extends] (astro-ph/0104421). This research also motivates further investigation into the characteristics of QPOs in black-hole candidates, as the findings suggest a physical relationship between different QPO features [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104421).
