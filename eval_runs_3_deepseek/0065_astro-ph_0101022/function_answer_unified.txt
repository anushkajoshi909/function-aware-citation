The proposal by Fuller & Shi provides background for the generation of gravitational waves during the formation of supermassive black holes by suggesting that the collapse of supermassive objects could be a source of these waves [Background] (astro-ph/0101022). Their model is used to argue for the strong generation of gravitational waves, as the collapse of these objects is more energetic than compact mergers, potentially producing a high rate of gravitational wave bursts [Background] (astro-ph/0101022).
