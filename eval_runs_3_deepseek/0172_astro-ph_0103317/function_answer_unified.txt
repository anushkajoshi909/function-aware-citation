The current code's approach to solving the transfer of continuum and lines builds upon previous work in the field, utilizing methods such as the Accelerated Lambda Iteration and two stream Eddington approximation [Background] (astro-ph/0103317). Understanding this comparison requires background knowledge of radiative transfer and photoionized media, including the treatment of atomic data and physical parameters such as density and pressure distribution [Background] (astro-ph/0103317).
