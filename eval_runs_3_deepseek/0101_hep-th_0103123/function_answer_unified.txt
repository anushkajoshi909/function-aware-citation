The current study extends our understanding of the relationship between mass-loss rates and crystalline silicate features in AGB stars [Background] by suggesting that low mass-loss rate AGB stars might also form crystalline silicates, despite not showing the characteristic spectral features (astro-ph/0101256). This challenges the traditional interpretation that crystalline silicates are only present in high mass-loss rate objects [Extends] (astro-ph/0101256).
