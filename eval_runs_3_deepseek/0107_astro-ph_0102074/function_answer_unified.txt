The physics of gas accretion in young stellar clusters is a dynamic phenomenon where accretion rates vary greatly depending on the location of stars within the cluster [Background] (astro-ph/0102074). Accretion rates are modeled using either a tidal-lobe radius or Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius, with the choice depending on whether the cluster is gas-dominated or star-dominated [Background] (astro-ph/0102074).
