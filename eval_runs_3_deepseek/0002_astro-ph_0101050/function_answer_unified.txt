The study of NGC 3065 is motivated by its X-ray properties, which led to the discovery of its low-ionization nuclear emission-line region and broad, variable Balmer lines [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101050). Understanding its classification as a LINER with broad, variable Balmer lines requires background information on its optical spectra, which reveal a central black hole with a low accretion rate, and comparisons to other LINERs with similar properties [Background] (astro-ph/0101050).
