The local energy-density functional method uses existing nuclear physics calculations, such as the conventional mean field Skyrme-HFB and relativistic Hartree-BCS calculations, to investigate differential observables [Uses] (nucl-th/0101012). It extends these calculations by providing a more detailed treatment of pairing interactions and allowing for an extrapolation to pairing in infinite matter [Extends] (nucl-th/0101012).
