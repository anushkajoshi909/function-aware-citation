The current work extends previous research on quantum field theories by providing a reformulation of fermionic QFT in electromagnetic backgrounds using methods from multiparticle quantum mechanics [Extends] (hep-th/0103228). This extension was motivated by limitations in earlier studies, such as the need for a complete set of orthonormal modes and the dependence on coordinate or gauge choices, which are addressed by the new approach [Motivation] (hep-th/0103228).
