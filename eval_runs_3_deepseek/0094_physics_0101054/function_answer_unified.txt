The current work extends Einstein's introduction of coefficients of spontaneous and induced emission by reexamining it from the viewpoint of stochastic electrodynamics and deriving the Planck formula [Extends] (physics/0101054). It uses Einstein's work as a foundation to explain the energy discreteness in stochastic electrodynamics, ultimately leading to the derivation of the Planck formula [Uses] (physics/0101054).
