The extension of the Nonlinear Maxwell Theory suggests potential areas for future research by outlining the transition from Classical Electrodynamics to Extended Electrodynamics [Background] (hep-th/0101137). This extension motivates further exploration of nonlinear vacuum solutions and their properties [Background] (hep-th/0101137).
