The proposed unification model based on a semi-simple group compares favorably to conventional supersymmetric grand unified theories [Compares] as it solves the problems of large mass splitting and proton lifetime [Motivation] (hep-ph/0103251). This model is motivated by the need to address these issues, which are not adequately resolved by conventional theories [Motivation] (hep-ph/0103251).
