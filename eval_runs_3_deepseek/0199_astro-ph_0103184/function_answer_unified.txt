The discovery of non-thermal emission in dust-enshrouded Wolf-Rayet stars [Background] (astro-ph/0103184) extends our understanding of dust production by suggesting that wind compression in binary systems is necessary for efficient dust production, and it motivates a re-evaluation of single-star and binary stellar evolution models [Background] (astro-ph/0103184).
