The expansion of the Borel transform of a QCD amplitude near the infrared renormalon extends current methods by providing nontrivial constraints on the Borel amplitude that improve the accuracy of the ordinary perturbative expansion [Extends] (hep-ph/0101297). This extension suggests areas for future research, such as applying the improved Borel amplitude to other problems in QCD [Extends] (hep-ph/0101297).
