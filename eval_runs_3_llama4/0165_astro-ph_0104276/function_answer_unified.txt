The current understanding of Population III star formation can be extended by further numerical simulations that explore the collapse and fragmentation of primordial gas [Extends] (astro-ph/0103382). Future research is needed to better constrain the initial mass function of these stars, which will involve addressing new questions raised by recent simulations [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103382).
