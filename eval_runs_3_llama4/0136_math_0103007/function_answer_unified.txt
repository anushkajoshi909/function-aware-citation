The development of lossy data compression algorithms in the paper extends previous work by Wyner and Ziv in 1989 and utilizes methods from rate-distortion theory and pattern-matching algorithms [Extends] (math/0103007). The paper builds on a background of research in lossless compression, including the analysis of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm and the Asymptotic Equipartition Property [Background] (math/0103007).
