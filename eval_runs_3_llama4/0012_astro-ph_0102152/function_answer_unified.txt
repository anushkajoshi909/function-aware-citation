The comparison between big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background observations provides a background understanding of the universe's baryon abundance [Background] (astro-ph/0102152). This comparison motivates further investigation into potential conflicts between the two, such as those that may arise from hadronic decay of a massive particle, which could significantly alter the abundances of light elements and challenge the standard model of cosmology [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103411).
