The background information on skutterudite compounds provides context for understanding their electronic structure, which is dominated by Sb 5p states near the Fermi level [Background] (cond-mat/0103342). This understanding informs the use of photoemission spectroscopy to study the compounds, allowing for the estimation of the band gap and investigation of electron correlations [Uses] (cond-mat/0103342).
