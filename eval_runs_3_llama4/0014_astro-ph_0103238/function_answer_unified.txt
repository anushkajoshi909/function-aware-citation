The properties of host galaxies of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars provide background information on the origin of radio loudness, suggesting that radio-loud objects are powered by more massive black holes accreting at lower efficiency [Background] (astro-ph/0103238). Further research on host-galaxy studies may yet play a crucial role in resolving the long-standing problem of the origin of radio loudness, offering areas for future work [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103238).
