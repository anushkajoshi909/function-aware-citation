The analysis of Higgs boson couplings in the 2HDM(II) model motivates further investigation into the Standard Model-like scenario by considering alternative models that could produce similar results [Motivation] (hep-ph/0101208). This analysis extends our understanding of the scenario by deriving a pattern relation between the ratios of couplings and calculating loop couplings, allowing for the distinction between the SM and 2HDM(II) [Extends] (hep-ph/0101208).
