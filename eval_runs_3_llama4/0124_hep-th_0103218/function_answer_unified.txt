The concept of discrete scalar fields compares to existing theories such as MOND and Tsallis statistics by potentially putting MOND on a more solid physical basis and being regarded as proper for discrete-interaction systems described by Tsallis statistics [Compares] (hep-th/0103218). It utilizes these theories by introducing an effective-acceleration scale and using Tsallis parameter to measure how close a system is from its idealized asymptotic state [Uses] (hep-th/0103218).
