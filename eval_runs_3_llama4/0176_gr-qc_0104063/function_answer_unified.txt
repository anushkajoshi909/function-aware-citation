Limitations in previous methods for simulating binary black hole systems, such as reduced accuracy in highly nonlinear regimes [Motivation], motivated the development of new techniques that can be compared to existing approaches, like the standard mixed-order approach, in terms of accuracy and applicability, with the new methods showing significantly improved accuracy [Compares] (gr-qc/0103011).
