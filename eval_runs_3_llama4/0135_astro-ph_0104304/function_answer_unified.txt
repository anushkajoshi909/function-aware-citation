The comparison of restricted N-body models with self-consistent N-body simulations [Compares] informs future research on the interaction scenario between galaxies like NGC 4449 and DDO 125 by demonstrating the applicability of simple restricted N-body calculations, which will guide [FutureWork] further investigations into the origins of observed features, such as the extended HI disc, and the dynamical masses of interacting galaxies (astro-ph/0104304).
