Future research can extend the current understanding of the Church-Turing Theses in the context of general relativity theory by exploring non-Turing computations via Malament-Hogarth space-times [FutureWork] (gr-qc/0104023). This can lead to a deeper understanding of the theoretical limitations of future computers and deductive sciences, potentially revealing that certain forms of the Church-Turing Thesis cease to be valid in general relativity [FutureWork] (gr-qc/0104023).
