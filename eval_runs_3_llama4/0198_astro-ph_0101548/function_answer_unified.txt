The study of gas-phase abundances in the Magellanic Bridge is motivated by the presence of interstellar absorption lines from various elements, which provide insights into the chemical composition of the region [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101548). The relative gas-phase abundances in the Magellanic Bridge are similar to those found in Galactic halo clouds, despite a significantly lower metallicity, making it an interesting comparison [Compares] (astro-ph/0101548).
