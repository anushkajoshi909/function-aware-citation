The pulsation properties of SX Phe variables motivate further study of their evolutionary history in Galactic Globular Clusters and Local Group dwarf galaxies [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102029). This understanding extends to constraining the evolutionary history of Blue Stragglers and identifying the physical mechanisms triggering their formation [Extends] (astro-ph/0102029).
