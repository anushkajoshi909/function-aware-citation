The spectroscopic study of microlensed sources is motivated by the opportunity to study the kinematics of the Galactic bulge and the effects of extinction on these sources [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101092). This study uses datasets from spectrographic observations, such as those carried out with the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph, and templates like Kurucz model spectra to derive radial velocities and extinctions of the microlensed sources [Uses] (astro-ph/0101092).
