The general two-dimensional gravity model provides background information by elucidating the canonical form of the model and reviewing the general solution of the equations of motion in the massless case [Background] (gr-qc/0101033). The effective action derived from this model is used to reproduce known solutions, such as the Fisher and Roberts solutions, by excluding geometric fields and obtaining effective equations of motion for a scalar field [Uses] (gr-qc/0101033).
