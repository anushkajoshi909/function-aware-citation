Extensions of the standard model, such as supersymmetric extensions, build upon our current understanding of CP violation by incorporating loop corrections for physics beyond the Standard Model [Background] (hep-ph/0101259). The motivation for these extensions lies in the potential to systematically include new physics and determine the parameters of the standard model, thereby checking its validity in loop-induced processes [Motivation] (hep-ph/0101259).
