The current work compares [Compares] the performance of different models for X-ray burst oscillations by analyzing the properties of noise components and quasi-periodic oscillations (astro-ph/0104323). It uses [Uses] Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data to study the relation between the frequencies of the horizontal branch and upper kHz QPOs (astro-ph/0104323).
