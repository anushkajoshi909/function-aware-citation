The investigation of MgB$_2$ is motivated by its unique electronic properties, which set it apart from other diborides due to the strong charge anisotropy at the B site [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104346). MgB$_2$ compares to other diborides in terms of its electronic properties, with its exceptionally high $T_c$ explained through the BCS mechanism and phonon softening, and its mixed bonding character verified through density of states and charge density analyses [Compares] (cond-mat/0104253).
