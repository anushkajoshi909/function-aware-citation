The dynamic and adaptive method for domain decomposition in the parallel tree-code originates from its background in astrophysics simulations, where it is used to efficiently simulate self-gravitating systems [Background] (astro-ph/0104152). This method is utilized to achieve low computational costs, as it enables the domain decomposition to be performed 'on the fly' and reduces parallelization overhead to less than 4% of the total CPU-time, making it useful for large-scale simulations [Uses] (astro-ph/0104152).
