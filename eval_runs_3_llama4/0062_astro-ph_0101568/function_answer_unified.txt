The work on the self-gravitating non-relativistic gas at thermal equilibrium motivates [Motivation] further research into structure formation in astrophysical systems by highlighting the importance of gravity and open systems (astro-ph/0101265). It extends previous research [Extends] by demonstrating the possibility of maintaining a molecular cloud in a statistically steady state through physically realistic boundary conditions (astro-ph/0101265).
