The discovery of a subparsec-scale dense plasma torus around an active galactic nucleus provides background information on the accretion process, suggesting a transition from radial to rotational accretion [Background] (astro-ph/0104039). This finding motivates further research into the role of plasma tori in accretion processes, potentially shedding light on the complex dynamics around active galactic nuclei [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104039).
