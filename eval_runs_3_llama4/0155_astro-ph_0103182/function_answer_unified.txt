The distinct types of hard steady states in GRS 1915+105, characterized by their X-ray spectral and timing properties, provide a foundation for understanding the underlying accretion flow [Background] (astro-ph/0103182). These findings suggest potential avenues for future research, including the study of radio emission and its relationship to X-ray properties, which may reveal new insights into the accretion flow and compact radio jets [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0104067).
