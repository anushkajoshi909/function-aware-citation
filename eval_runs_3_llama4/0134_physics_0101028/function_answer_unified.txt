The development of the coupled microwave-cavity system provides background for axion detection by utilizing a conversion cavity to convert axions into photons and a detection cavity to detect these photons [Background] (physics/0101028). This setup enables future improvements in axion detection, with characteristics and performance discussed alongside possible future enhancements [FutureWork] (physics/0101028).
