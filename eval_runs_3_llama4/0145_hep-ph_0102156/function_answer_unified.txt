The RIMH models, which arise from SUSY SO(10) grand unified theories, provide a background for understanding the SUSY flavor and CP problems by suggesting a promising way to reconcile naturalness with a decoupling solution [Background] (hep-ph/0102156). These models compare favorably to other approaches in terms of solving these problems, but suffer from limitations such as restricted parameter space and accessibility to collider searches [Compares] (hep-ph/0102156).
