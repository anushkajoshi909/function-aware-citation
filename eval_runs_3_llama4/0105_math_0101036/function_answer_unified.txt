Geometrical stability theory provides background for the study of homogeneous models by offering a set of model-theoretic tools that lead to structural results on models of a simple first-order theory [Background] (math/0101036). It extends the theory to non-saturated structures by showing that the canonical base exists in strongly lambda-homogeneous models, which have noncompact Stone topologies [Extends] (math/0101036).
