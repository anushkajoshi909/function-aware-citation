The differences in quasiperiodic oscillations between neutron star and black hole systems motivate further research [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104008). Future work may investigate the application of the transition layer model to black hole candidates and accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsars [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0104008).
