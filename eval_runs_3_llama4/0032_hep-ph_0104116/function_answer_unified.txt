The 2-3 symmetry provides motivation [Motivation] for understanding the neutrino mass matrix by predicting maximum mixing in atmospheric neutrino oscillation and vanishing of the MNS matrix element $U_{e3}$, which is consistent with experimental results (hep-ph/0104116). This symmetry also extends [Extends] our understanding of neutrino mass matrix and its predictions by allowing for a deviation from these predictions at experimental energies due to renormalization-group corrections and providing a novel mass lower bound that can be falsified by future experiments (hep-ph/0104116).
