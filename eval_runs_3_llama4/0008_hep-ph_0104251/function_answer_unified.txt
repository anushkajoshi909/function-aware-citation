The thesis extends the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model by considering a generic supersymmetric standard model without imposed R-parity [Extends] (hep-ph/0104276). It compares its results with existing theories on baryogenesis and cosmic rays by reviewing phenomenological features such as R-parity violating contributions to scalar masses [Compares] (hep-ph/0104276).
