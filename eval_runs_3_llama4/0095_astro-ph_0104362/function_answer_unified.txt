The immense energy released by gamma-ray bursts, which is thousand times stronger than supernova explosions [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101147), motivates further analysis of their energetic properties, and comparing their energy mechanisms to those of supernovae [Compares] (astro-ph/0101147) can provide insights into their unconventional energy release processes.
