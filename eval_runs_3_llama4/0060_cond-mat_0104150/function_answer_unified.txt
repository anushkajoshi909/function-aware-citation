The discovery of a gapped spectrum in Piperazinium Hexachlorodicuprate could motivate future research into frustrated quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104150). This motivation may lead to investigations of field-induced ordered phases and the effects of magnetic fields on the gap in similar materials [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104150).
