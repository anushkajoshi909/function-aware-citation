Current limitations in understanding supernova explosions and their interactions with the circumstellar medium, such as the unclear connections between supernovae and their progenitor stars [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101043), motivate further research, which may involve multi-dimensional hydrodynamics and a better understanding of neutrino interactions to resolve the problem of spherical models not yielding explosions [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103015).
