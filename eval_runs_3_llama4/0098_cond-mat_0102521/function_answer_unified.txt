The coarsening behaviors of the CD models on different surfaces compare in terms of the exponent values, with the EW surface exhibiting an exponent of 1/2 and the GBDT surface showing conventional coarsening behavior with an exponent of 1 [Compares] (cond-mat/0102521). Analytic and numerical methods are used to analyze these behaviors, including the independent interval approximation and the study of scaled density-density correlation functions [Uses] (cond-mat/0102521).
