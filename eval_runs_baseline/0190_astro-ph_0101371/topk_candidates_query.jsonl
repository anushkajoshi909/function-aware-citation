We present simulations of\nINTEGRAL observations of nearby galaxy clusters that show its capability for\ndetecting the different phenomena responsible of clusters emission.", "abstract_full": "Cluster of galaxies are the largest concentrations of visible mass in the\nUniverse and therefore a fundamental topic of cosmology and astrophysics.\nRecent radio, EUV, and X-ray observations suggest that clusters contain large\npopulations of diffuse nonthermal relativistic and/or superthermal particles.\nThese particles may be produced by acceleration in cluster merger shocks, AGNs,\nand/or supernovae in cluster galaxies. Models for the nonthermal populations in\nclusters indicate that they should produce substantial hard X-ray and $\\gamma$\nluminosities. The possible role of nonthermal particles in the dynamics of\nclusters is one of the greatest uncertainties in their use as cosmological\nprobes. INTEGRAL offers, for the first time, the possibility of simultaneous\nmedium resolution imaging (~ 12 arcmin) and high resolution spectroscopy\n(DeltaE/E ~ 2 keV @ 1.3 MeV) with exceptional sensitivity in the hard\nX-ray/soft gamma-ray band. The spatial resolution will allow discrete sources,\nsuch as AGNs, to be separated from the diffuse emission of the cluster. For\nnearby clusters, the spatial distribution of emission can be determined and\ncompared to models for the nonthermal particle populations and observations in\nother wavebands. The spectral capabilities may allow different components of\nthe nonthermal population to be detected separately.
