We found\ntwo different couplings, one during the pre-eclipse dips and the other during\nthe normal state of the source, using a method which directly compares the\nlow-frequency power-density spectra (PDS) with those of the sidebands around\nthe coherent pulse frequency. The pre-eclipse dip lightcurves show significant\ntime variation of photon counts, and this variation appears in the PDS as both\nstrong mHz powers and well-developed sidebands around the coherent pulse\nfrequency. The linear correlation coefficients between the mHz PDS and the\nsideband PDS obtained from two pre-eclipse dip data segments are 0.880 +- 0.003\nand 0.982 +- 0.001, respectively. This very strong coupling demonstrates that\nthe amplitudes of the coherent pulsations are almost exactly modulated by the\naperiodic variabilities, suggesting that both the periodic and aperiodic\nvariabilities are related to time variation of obscuration of X-rays from the\ncentral pulsar by an accretion disk during pre-eclipse dips.

We found\ntwo different couplings, one during the pre-eclipse dips and the other during\nthe normal state of the source, using a method which directly compares the\nlow-frequency power-density spectra (PDS) with those of the sidebands around\nthe coherent pulse frequency. The pre-eclipse dip lightcurves show significant\ntime variation of photon counts, and this variation appears in the PDS as both\nstrong mHz powers and well-developed sidebands around the coherent pulse\nfrequency. The linear correlation coefficients between the mHz PDS and the\nsideband PDS obtained from two pre-eclipse dip data segments are 0.880 +- 0.003\nand 0.982 +- 0.001, respectively. This very strong coupling demonstrates that\nthe amplitudes of the coherent pulsations are almost exactly modulated by the\naperiodic variabilities, suggesting that both the periodic and aperiodic\nvariabilities are related to time variation of obscuration of X-rays from the\ncentral pulsar by an accretion disk during pre-eclipse dips.
