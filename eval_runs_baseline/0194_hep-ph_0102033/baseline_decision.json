  "answer": "The problem of calculating multi-loop master integrals motivated the development of a new method based on numerical solutions of systems of difference equations, as seen in the work on high-precision calculation of multi-loop Feynman integrals (hep-ph/0102033).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "hep-ph/0102033",
  "explanation": "This paper best supports the answer because it describes a new method for calculating generic multi-loop master integrals using numerical solutions of systems of difference equations, which directly addresses the problem in question.",
