  "answer": "The extension of the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm to include surface fields relates to the use of power laws predicted by Fisher and Nakanishi, as shown in the study of capillary condensation critical point (cond-mat/0101198).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "cond-mat/0101198",
  "explanation": "This paper directly addresses the relationship between the extension of the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm and the power laws predicted by Fisher and Nakanishi, making it the most relevant choice.",
  "evidence_quote": "consistent with the power laws predicted by Fisher and Nakanishi",
