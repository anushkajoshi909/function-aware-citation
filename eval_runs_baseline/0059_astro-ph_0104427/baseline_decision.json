  "answer": "The template spectra of normal galaxies along the Hubble sequence relate to previous studies in terms of observational approach and spectral characteristics, as seen in astro-ph/0104427, which defines template spectra of normal galaxies along the Hubble sequence (astro-ph/0104427).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0104427",
  "explanation": "This paper best supports the answer because it directly addresses the definition of template spectra of normal galaxies along the Hubble sequence, providing a clear connection to previous studies.",
