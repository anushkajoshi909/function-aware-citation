  "answer": "Future research could be motivated by the limitations of current photon emission calculations in high-energy collisions, such as the need for more accurate treatments of energy conservation and multiple scattering theory (hep-ph/0103302).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "hep-ph/0103302",
  "explanation": "This paper discusses the inconsistencies in currently used models for high energy nuclear scattering and introduces a fully self-consistent formulation of the multiple-scattering scheme, which could motivate future research in this area.",
