  "answer": "Future studies of microlensing events can build on our current understanding of the optical depth and time-scale distribution of these events in the context of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy by analyzing the fraction of events involving a source in Sgr and the contribution of the MW/Sgr events (astro-ph/0102013).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0102013",
  "explanation": "This paper provides an estimate of the optical depth, time-scale distribution, and fraction of microlensing events originating from sources in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which is relevant to building on our current understanding of these events.",
  "evidence_quote": "We estimate the optical depth, time-scale distribution",
