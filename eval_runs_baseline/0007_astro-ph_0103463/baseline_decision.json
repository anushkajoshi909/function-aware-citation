  "answer": "Future research areas include investigating strong gravitational lensing by multiple galaxies and constraining lens mass models, as current methods have limitations in predicting the maximum number of images produced by n-tuple lenses (astro-ph/0103093).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0103093",
  "explanation": "This paper discusses strong gravitational lensing by multiple objects along any line of sight and estimates the likelihood for gravitational lensing by two lenses at different redshifts, making it relevant to the limitations of current methods.",
