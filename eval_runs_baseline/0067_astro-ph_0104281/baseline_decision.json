  "answer": "The X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 motivates the development of a two-phase model, as its flat X-ray spectrum is among the flattest known for Seyferts, with Gamma_x = -1.5, indicating a two-phase equilibrium (astro-ph/0104281).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0104281",
  "explanation": "This paper presents a two-phase model for the Narrow Line Region of NGC 4151, motivated by the flat X-ray spectrum and recent Chandra detection of an X-ray narrow-line region.",
