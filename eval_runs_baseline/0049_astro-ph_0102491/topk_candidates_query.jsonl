For determination of the\nformation process of hydrogen molecules, future observational facilities can be\nuseful. Thus, we examine the detectability in some wavelengths for the metal\ndeficient galaxies. According to our estimate, near-infrared line emission of\nhydrogen molecule is observable in the level of 10 $\\mu$Jy, the free-free radio\nemission is in the level of mJy, and the far-infrared emission from the dust on\nwhich hydrogen molecules form can also be detected with 10-mJy level with its\ntemperature of 16 K. The near-infrared line and the far-infrared continuum are\nfeasible for ASTRO-F observations.", "authors": "Hideyuki Kamaya, Hiroyuki Hirashita", "year": "2001", "retrieved_at": "2025-10-26T16:43:32"}
