  "answer": "The current work is motivated by the need to understand state transitions in black-hole candidates like GRO J1655-40, which requires background information on optical emission lines and accretion flows (astro-ph/0101305).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0101305",
  "explanation": "This paper is relevant because it discusses optical spectroscopic studies of emission lines in black-hole candidates and identifies state transitions in GRO J1655-40.",
  "evidence_quote": "Optical spectroscopic studies of emission lines",
