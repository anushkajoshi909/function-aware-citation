  "answer": "The current work extends previous research on baryon fraction in clusters to inform the estimation of the cosmological density parameter by analyzing the baryon distribution in clusters and combining it with constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis, as seen in astro-ph/0102010. This approach provides a robust upper limit on the cosmological density parameter (astro-ph/0102010).",
