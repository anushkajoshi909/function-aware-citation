  "answer": "The study of KK graviton self-interactions at a future Graviton Factory can extend our understanding of the 5-d Randall-Sundrum model by probing the accuracy of the 5-d Einstein gravity picture and yielding indirect information on the self-coupling of the 4-d graviton (hep-ph/0104199).",
