  "answer": "Previous methods for simulating binary black hole systems had limitations in terms of accuracy and applicability, which motivated the development of new techniques, such as the Lazarus project (gr-qc/0104063).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "gr-qc/0104063",
  "explanation": "The Lazarus project presents a method to combine 3D numerical simulations and a single black hole close-limit approximation, making it possible to compute complete waveforms for binary black hole systems.",
