  "answer": "The current work uses and compares with previous studies of circumstellar disks around classical T Tauri stars, such as the study of TW Hydrae (astro-ph/0103458).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0103458",
  "explanation": "This paper is relevant because it presents a study of the circumstellar disk around TW Hydrae, a classical T Tauri star, and derives properties of the disk using a simple model of emission from an optically thick, flat disk.",
  "evidence_quote": "circumstellar disk around the nearby classical T Tauri star TW Hydrae",
