  "answer": "The analysis of Higgs boson couplings in the 2HDM(II) model motivates and extends our understanding of the Standard Model-like scenario by providing a pattern relation between the ratios of couplings (hep-ph/0101208).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "hep-ph/0101208",
  "explanation": "This paper compares the SM and the 2HDM(II) and derives a relation between the ratios of couplings, which helps to resolve SM-like scenarios.",
  "evidence_quote": "In the analysis we use as independent quantities the ratios",
