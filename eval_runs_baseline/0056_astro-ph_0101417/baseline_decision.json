  "answer": "The study of Hercules X-1 in an anomalous low state provides insight into X-ray binary systems, as seen in the observations of the eclipsing X-ray binary Hercules X-1 conducted during an anomalous low state (astro-ph/0101417).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0101417",
  "explanation": "This paper is relevant because it presents RXTE observations of Hercules X-1 during an anomalous low state, which helps to understand the behavior of X-ray binary systems in such states.",
