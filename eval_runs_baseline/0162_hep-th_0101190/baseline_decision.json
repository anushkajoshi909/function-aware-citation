  "answer": "The current work extends existing theories on massless fields and helicity representations by considering the covariant, spinor sets of relativistic wave equations for a massless field, as seen in hep-th/0101190.",
  "predicted_paper_id": "hep-th/0101190",
  "explanation": "This paper provides a universal description of the states with integer and half-integer helicity, and also discusses the infinite-dimensional representations corresponding to massless states with fractional helicity.",
  "evidence_quote": "massless field on the basis of the two copies of the R-deformed Heisenberg algebra",
