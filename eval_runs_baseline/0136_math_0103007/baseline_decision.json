  "answer": "The development of lossy data compression algorithms relates to previous work by utilizing the Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) and building upon the work of Wyner and Ziv in 1989 (math/0103007).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "math/0103007",
  "explanation": "This paper provides a development of parts of rate-distortion theory and pattern-matching algorithms for lossy data compression, closely paralleling the corresponding development in lossless compression.",
  "evidence_quote": "a lossy version of the Asymptotic Equipartition Property",
