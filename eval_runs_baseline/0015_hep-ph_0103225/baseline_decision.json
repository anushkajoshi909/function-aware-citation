  "answer": "The study of the exclusive decay of heavy quarkonium is motivated by the desire to understand how gluons are converted into pions and to provide information about s-wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering (hep-ph/0103225).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "hep-ph/0103225",
  "explanation": "This paper directly addresses the exclusive decay of heavy quarkonium into a photon and two pions, providing insight into the conversion of gluons into pions and s-wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering.",
