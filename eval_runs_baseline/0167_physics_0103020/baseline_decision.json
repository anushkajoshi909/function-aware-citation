  "answer": "The current work's understanding of electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves differs from previous thoughts, as it shows that the charge density variation is a net balance of negative charge from trapped electrons and positive charge due to the decrease of the passing electron density (physics/0103020).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "physics/0103020",
  "explanation": "This paper reexamines the physical roles of trapped and passing electrons in electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves, providing a new understanding of the charge density variation.",
