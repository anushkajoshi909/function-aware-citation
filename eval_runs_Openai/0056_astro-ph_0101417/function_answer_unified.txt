The study of Hercules X-1 in an anomalous low state extends our understanding of X-ray binary systems by providing insights into the behavior of accretion disks and the geometry of accretion curtains [Extends] (astro-ph/0102100). It also provides background information on the behavior of these systems, including the reflection of X-rays by the companion star and the modulation of count rates with the orbital period [Background] (astro-ph/0101417).
