The current work's approach to simulating X-ray surface brightness distribution [Compares] existing methods by using simulations to predict the distribution from diffuse gas, as seen in astro-ph/0101467. It [Extends] these methods by exploring the effects of non-gravitational heating on the distribution, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the extra-galactic X-ray background (astro-ph/0101467).
