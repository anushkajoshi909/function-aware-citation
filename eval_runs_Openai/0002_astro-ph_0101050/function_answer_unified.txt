The study of NGC 3065 is motivated by its X-ray properties, which led to the discovery of its low-ionization nuclear emission-line region and broad, variable Balmer lines [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101050), and understanding its classification as a LINER requires background information on its optical spectra and comparison to other LINERs with similar properties [Background] (astro-ph/0101050).
