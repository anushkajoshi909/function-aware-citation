The current work extends our understanding of cosmic ray propagation by testing the Cen A model of highest energy cosmic rays [Extends] (astro-ph/0103043). This is set against the background of expected high-precision measurements of cosmic ray nuclei fluxes, which may be affected by intergalactic magnetic fields and the anticipated aperture of the Southern Auger Observatory [Background] (astro-ph/0103043).
