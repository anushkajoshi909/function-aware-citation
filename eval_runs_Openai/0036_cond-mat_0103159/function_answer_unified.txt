The study of dimensional crossover in Hubbard ladders is motivated by the need to understand the odd-even effect and the transition from a 1D to a 2D system [Motivation] (cond-mat/0103159), which is set against the background of research on half-filled and lightly doped N-leg Hubbard ladders, where the crossover energy E_{c} plays a crucial role in determining the system's behavior [Background] (cond-mat/0103159).
