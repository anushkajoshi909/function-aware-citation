The current model of electromagnetic structure black holes can be extended to study longer bursts with baryonic matter by exploring the possibility of a quasi-stationary shell of hot matter surrounding microscopic black holes [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0101515). This extension can lead to new research directions, such as describing the conditions exterior to microscopic black holes and detecting them [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0101515).
