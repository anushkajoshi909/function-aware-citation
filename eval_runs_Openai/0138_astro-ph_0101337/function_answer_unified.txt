Understanding state transitions in black-hole candidates like GRO J1655-40 requires background knowledge of optical spectroscopic studies and their relation to X-ray state transitions [Background] (astro-ph/0101305). The current work is motivated by the need to investigate these state transitions, which is driven by the changes in optical line profiles that reflect alterations in the accretion flow geometry [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101305).
