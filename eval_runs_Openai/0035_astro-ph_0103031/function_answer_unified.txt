The use of statistical methods to study the correlation between radio and gamma-ray luminosities in blazars is motivated by the need to understand the complex variability patterns observed in these objects, such as 3C 279, which exhibits substantial gamma-ray contribution to its total luminosity [Background] (astro-ph/0102127). This motivation arises from the lack of a clear pattern of time correlation between different frequency bands, prompting further investigation into the relationship between radio and gamma-ray luminosities [Background] (astro-ph/0102127).
