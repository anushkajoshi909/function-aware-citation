The spectroscopic study of microlensed sources is motivated by the opportunity to study the kinematics of the Galactic bulge and the effects of extinction on these sources [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101092). It uses datasets from spectrographic studies, such as those carried out with the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph, and templates like Kurucz model spectra to derive radial velocities and extinctions [Uses] (astro-ph/0101092).
