The discovery of giant micro-pulses and a large amplitude gaussian component in the Vela pulsar's pulse profile motivates future research directions to further investigate these unique features [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101146). This motivation is driven by the need to understand the underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena, such as the periodicity and polarization properties of the gaussian component [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101146).
