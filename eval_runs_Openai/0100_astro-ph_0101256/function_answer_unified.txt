The current study extends our understanding of the relationship between mass-loss rates and crystalline silicate features in AGB stars by showing that low mass-loss rate AGB stars might also form crystalline silicates [Extends] (astro-ph/0101256). This finding is set against the background knowledge that ISO observations have linked crystalline silicate features to high mass-loss rates in O-rich AGB stars [Background] (astro-ph/0101256).
