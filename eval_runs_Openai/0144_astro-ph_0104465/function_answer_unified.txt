The results of this study compare to previous models of the Milky Way by suggesting that a significantly flattened dark matter halo is only possible if certain Galactic constants are within specific ranges [Compares] (astro-ph/0104465). The findings on dark matter halo shapes and Galactic constants suggest future research directions, such as investigating the effects of uncertain gaseous velocity dispersion on HI flaring constraints [Compares] (astro-ph/0104465).
