Future research can extend the current understanding of the Church-Turing Theses in the context of general relativity theory by exploring non-Turing computations via Malament-Hogarth space-times [FutureWork] (gr-qc/0104023). This can lead to a deeper understanding of the limitations of computers and deductive sciences in different background physical theories [FutureWork] (gr-qc/0104023).
