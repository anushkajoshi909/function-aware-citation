The two-fluid model of diffusive shock acceleration provides background information for understanding the production of energetic cosmic rays by analyzing the acceleration of relativistic particles due to repeated scattering across a shock wave [Background] (astro-ph/0101020). The motivation for using this model stems from its ability to explain the production of energetic cosmic rays through the acceleration process, which has been extensively analyzed over the past two decades [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101020).
