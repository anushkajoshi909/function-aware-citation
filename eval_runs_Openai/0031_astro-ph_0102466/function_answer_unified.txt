Future research could utilize the methods presented in this study to further investigate the power spectrum of density fluctuations by applying nonlinear corrections and PCA to improve the goodness of fit and reduce bias [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0101361). This approach may allow for a better understanding of the power spectrum, including potential wiggles and deviations from the LCDM model [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0101361).
