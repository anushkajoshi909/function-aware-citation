The detection of upper main sequence stars and red giant branch stars in the halo of an amorphous galaxy [Compares] previous work on galaxy interactions, as the observed stars are likely the result of star formation triggered by tidal interaction (astro-ph/0103121). This study is set against the [Background] of galaxy distance measurements, where the detected red giant branch luminosity function is used to estimate a distance modulus that agrees with other galaxies in the M81 Group (astro-ph/0103121).
