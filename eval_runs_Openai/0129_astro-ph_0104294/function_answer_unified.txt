The discovery of high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ sources motivates the study of chemically primitive galaxies in the early universe by providing insights into the chemical properties of galaxy-like objects at high redshift [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104308). This discovery extends our understanding of galaxy formation by suggesting that extended Lyman alpha emission around young quasars can constrain models of galaxy formation and provide insights into the distribution of infalling cold gas [Extends] (astro-ph/0101174).
