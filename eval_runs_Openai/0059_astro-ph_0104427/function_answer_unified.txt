The current work compares to previous research on the magnetic state of doped SrB$_{6}$ by investigating the effects of different impurities on the electronic structure [Compares] (cond-mat/0103180). It extends this research by demonstrating the persistence of a weak ferromagnetic state at lower doping levels and exploring the correlation between charge transfer and magnetic moment [Extends] (cond-mat/0103180).
