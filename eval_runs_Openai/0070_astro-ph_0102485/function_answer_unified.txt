The properties of SNe II-L and SNe IIn extend our understanding of supernovae by showing evidence of late-time interaction with circumstellar material and unusually dense circumstellar gas [Extends] (astro-ph/0102485). They compare to other types of supernovae, such as SNe Ib and SNe Ic, which have distinct spectral features, and SNe II-P, which have smaller asymmetries in their ejecta [Compares] (astro-ph/0102485).
