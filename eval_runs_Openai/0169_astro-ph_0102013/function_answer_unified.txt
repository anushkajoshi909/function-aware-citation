Extensions of the standard model, such as supersymmetric extensions, build upon our current understanding of CP violation by incorporating new physics beyond the electroweak standard model through loop corrections [Background] (hep-ph/0101259). These extensions allow for a systematic inclusion of new physics to determine standard model parameters and check its validity in loop-induced processes [Background] (hep-ph/0101259).
