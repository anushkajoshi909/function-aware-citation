The background information on skutterudite compounds informs the use of photoemission spectroscopy in this study [Background] by providing insight into the electronic structure of these compounds, which is essential for interpreting the photoemission spectra (cond-mat/0103342). The study of skutterudite compounds like Co(Sb$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$)$_3$ and RhSb$_3$ using photoemission spectroscopy reveals their valence-band spectra and allows for the estimation of the band gap [Background] (cond-mat/0103342).
