The limitation of not accounting for quantum effects in the collective atomic recoil laser motivated the extension of the semiclassical model [Motivation] (cond-mat/0102360). The extension uses the Maxwell-Bloch equations for two momentum levels, which are recovered from the CARL equations when the average atomic momentum is less than the recoil momentum [Uses] (cond-mat/0102360).
