The current work's methods compare to those of previous redshift surveys [Compares] in terms of understanding large-scale structure, as they build upon the progress made by earlier surveys like the CfA redshift survey and will be further improved by ongoing surveys (astro-ph/0104418). The current work uses redshift surveys [Uses] to achieve unprecedented precision in understanding the statistical clustering of low-redshift galaxies, similar to the 2DF redshift survey and the SDSS survey (astro-ph/0104418).
