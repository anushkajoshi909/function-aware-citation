The limitations of current cosmological parameter constraints could motivate future research in areas such as cosmology and theoretical physics [Motivation] (hep-ph/0103349). Potential areas of future work may include exploring the implications of standard model couplings for cosmology and developing new theoretical frameworks [FutureWork] (hep-ph/0103349).
