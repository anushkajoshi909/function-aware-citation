The limitations in previous studies of star formation rates in Lyman break galaxies, which motivated the current work [Motivation], were the uncertainties in calibrations of star formation tracers and the potential for differential extinction between rest-frame optical and UV [Compares] (astro-ph/0102456). The current work compares to previous expectations by finding that the star formation rates deduced from Hbeta luminosity are on average no larger than those implied by the stellar continuum at 1500 A [Compares] (astro-ph/0102456).
