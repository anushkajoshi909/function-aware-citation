The current work's approach to investigating high energy radiation mechanisms compares to other studies by identifying distinct parameter space regions where different spectral components dominate [Compares] (astro-ph/0103229). Future research directions are suggested by the identification of these regions, including the detection of inverse Compton and proton high energy components in various bands with future missions such as GLAST and Chandra [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103229).
