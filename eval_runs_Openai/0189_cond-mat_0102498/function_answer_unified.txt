The current work uses a high-resolution transmission electron microscope to investigate the microstructure of the MgB2 superconductor [Uses] (cond-mat/0102498). It aims to solve the problem of understanding the physics of high-Tc superconductivity by studying the microstructure of MgB2, which has a simple composition and structure, potentially leading to higher Tc values [Motivation] (cond-mat/0102507).
