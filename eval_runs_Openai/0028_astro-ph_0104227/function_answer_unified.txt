Future studies can utilize the current analysis of populous clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud to further understand its structure by exploring the suggested correlation between cluster properties and position on the sky [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0104227). The dataset and methods from this work, such as analyzing age, metal abundance, and positional data, can be used in such studies to probe the structure of the Small Magellanic Cloud [Extends] (astro-ph/0104227).
