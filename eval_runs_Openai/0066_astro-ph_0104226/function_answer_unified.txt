The current study's use of a 2-D hydro code allows for a detailed understanding of the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarfs, including the effects of convective flows and mixing on the ignition process [Uses] (astro-ph/0104226). This approach provides new insights into the explosive nuclear burning and flame propagation, differing from other methods that may not account for these complex processes [Uses] (astro-ph/0104226).
