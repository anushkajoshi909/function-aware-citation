The possibility of a low value of sin2β motivates the construction of a reference unitarity triangle [Motivation] (hep-ph/0103040). The construction of this triangle is based on established methods that involve fitting experimental data and theory calculations to indirectly determine the vertex and angles of the unitarity triangle [Background] (hep-ph/0103040).
