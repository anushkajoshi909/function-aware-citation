Researchers will use multi-lens ray-tracing to estimate the likelihood of gravitational lensing by multiple objects and investigate image geometries and magnification cross sections. This method will be applied to improve understanding of strong gravitational lensing by multiple galaxies and to constrain lens models of individual systems (astro-ph/0103093). [Uses]
The method of multi-lens ray-tracing will be used in future research to improve our understanding of strong gravitational lensing by multiple objects, particularly in constraining lens models and statistical lensing. Future studies will account for effects such as external shear and aligned discs in lensing galaxies to better model multiple lens systems (astro-ph/0103093). [FutureWork]
