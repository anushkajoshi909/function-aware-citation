The analysis of the X-ray source is motivated by the need to understand the properties of black holes in stellar binary systems, particularly their mass and spin. Investigating these properties matters because it can provide insights into the physics of accretion flows and energy flow modes (astro-ph/0103431). [Motivation]
The Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite is used to obtain X-ray luminosity time series data for analyzing the time evolution of the power spectrum of XTE J1550-564. The authors apply new methods, along with a comparison to the dynamic power spectrum, to understand the time-frequency variations of the X-ray source (astro-ph/0104057). [Uses]
