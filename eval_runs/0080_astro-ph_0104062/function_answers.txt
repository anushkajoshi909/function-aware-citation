The methods used to analyze the absorption feature in GRB 990705, such as investigating production mechanisms and modeling photoionization and resonant scattering, can inform future research on supernova remnants by helping to understand their properties and impact on afterglow generation. These methods can be applied to study the physical conditions and geometry of absorbing material in supernova remnants (astro-ph/0104062). [Uses]
The methods used to analyze the absorption feature in GRB 990705 may inform future research on supernova remnants by exploring how they impact afterglow generation, particularly in scenarios where the remnant surrounds the burst site. Further study is needed to understand the physical conditions and geometry of the absorbing material in relation to afterglow production (astro-ph/0104062). [FutureWork]
