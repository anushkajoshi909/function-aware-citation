The electronic properties of thick metallic silver films deposited on Si(111)-(7x7) substrates at room temperature are compared to the expected properties based on their background structure, with the films exhibiting a sixfold symmetry instead of the expected threefold symmetry of Ag single crystal. The comparison is based on the Fermi surface topology and symmetry, as determined by angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (cond-mat/0104186). [Compares]
The electronic properties of thick metallic silver films deposited on Si(111)-(7x7) substrates at room temperature exhibit a sixfold symmetry instead of the expected threefold symmetry, and their Fermi surface has a three-dimensional character (cond-mat/0104186). [Background]
