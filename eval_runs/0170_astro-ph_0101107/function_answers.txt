The current study's finding on the lower mass threshold for Hot Bottom Burning is consistent with existing stellar evolution models, but the observed luminosity of the carbon star is lower than predicted. The discrepancy between observed and predicted luminosity could be resolved through further research on the stellar evolution of carbon stars (astro-ph/0101107). [Compares]
