The expansion of the Borel transform of a QCD amplitude near the infrared renormalon extends current methods by providing a mechanism to calculate nonperturbative effects from perturbation theory. This approach improves accuracy by allowing the calculation of QCD condensate effects from perturbation theory, going beyond previous limitations (hep-ph/0104306). [Extends]
The expansion of the Borel transform near the infrared renormalon suggests that some QCD condensate effects can be calculated from perturbation theory, opening up areas for future research in resumming perturbation theory to access nonperturbative effects. This approach may extend current methods by enabling the calculation of nonperturbative effects from perturbation theory combined with exactly calculable properties (hep-ph/0104306). [FutureWork]
