The proposal by Fuller & Shi provides background for the generation of gravitational waves during the formation of supermassive black holes by suggesting that the collapse of supermassive objects could be a source of strong gravitational waves (astro-ph/0101022). [Background]
Fuller & Shi's proposal is used to provide background for the generation of gravitational waves during the formation of supermassive black holes, as their model of supermassive object collapses is applied to argue for the strong generation of these waves. Their model is utilized to estimate the rate of gravitational wave bursts, which could be as high as the rate of gamma-ray bursts (astro-ph/0101022). [Uses]
