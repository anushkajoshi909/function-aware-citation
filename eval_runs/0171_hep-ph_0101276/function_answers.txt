Future experiments can extend the current analysis by systematically including new physics in loop-induced processes, potentially improving the accuracy of CP-violating observables. The standard method of assuming the standard model's correctness for tree-level processes can be extended to also validate its loop-induced processes (hep-ph/0101259). [Extends]
Future experiments can extend the current analysis by measuring the remaining two new-physics observables, which are likely to be accessible at second-generation B experiments. Additionally, further studies are needed to establish scenarios where new-physics effects arise at the decay-amplitude level, which could be indicated by a small value of the mixing-induced CP asymmetry (hep-ph/0101276).
