The limitations of current gravitational lensing methods in predicting the maximum number of images produced by n-tuple lenses motivate further research into the topological properties of n-point lens systems and the bounds of image production. This is important because understanding these limitations can help refine predictions and potentially reveal new insights into the behavior of gravitational lenses (astro-ph/0103463). [Motivation]
Future research may investigate the effects of external shear and aligned discs in lensing galaxies on image configurations and magnification cross sections. Accounting for these effects in lens modeling is necessary to improve predictions of multiple imaging cross sections in multiple lens systems (astro-ph/0103093). [FutureWork]
