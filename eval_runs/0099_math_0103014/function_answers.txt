The analysis of the cyclic group of units in Z_k can be extended by exploring the properties of the subgroup F_k, which properly contains the core A_k for k > 2, and by applying quadratic analysis to derive the additive structure of subgroups G_k and F_k. This extends the prior method of linear analysis, such as Hensel's lemma, to achieve a more accurate understanding of residue arithmetic (math/0103014). [Extends]
The analysis of the cyclic group of units in Z_k can be extended by exploring the additive properties of its lattice and the Boolean lattice formed by idempotents. Future research can involve induction on k to extend residues mod m_k and yield a prime sieve for integers, potentially resolving Goldbach's Conjecture (math/0103091). [FutureWork]
