The analysis of the canonical structure for a gauge fixed PST bosonic five brane action provides a foundation for future research by establishing a master canonical action with only first class constraints and constructing a nilpotent BRST charge (hep-th/0103123). [Background]
The analysis of the canonical structure for a gauge fixed PST bosonic five brane action lays the groundwork for potential future research by providing a foundation for studying the algebra of diffeomorphisms and the Hamiltonian constraint for theories invariant under 6 dimensional diffeomorphisms. Future research can build upon this work by exploring the implications of the constructed BRST charge and its BRST invariant effective theory (hep-th/0103123). [FutureWork]
