The heating of X-ray hot gas in galaxy groups is thought to result from either external heating processes, such as AGN or population III stars, or internal heating by Type II supernovae (astro-ph/0101517). [Background]
Future work on the heating of X-Ray hot gas in galaxy groups can build on the finding that internal heating by Type II supernovae is a preferred mechanism, and investigate the implications of different initial mass functions on the energy required to heat the gas. The open problem of determining the exact epoch and spatial distribution of the supernova heating process also remains to be addressed (astro-ph/0101517). [FutureWork]
