The current work extends previous research on baryon fraction in clusters by re-examining the gas fraction profile and its implications for the cosmological density parameter, providing a more accurate estimation by considering factors such as gas clumping and calibration from numerical simulations. This extension challenges the previous conclusion of a low-density universe, suggesting that high values of the cosmological density parameter cannot be ruled out based on the baryon fraction argument (astro-ph/0102010).

The current work uses previous research on baryon fraction in clusters, such as Vikhlinin et al. (1999), to inform the estimation of the cosmological density parameter $\Omega_0$. [Uses]
