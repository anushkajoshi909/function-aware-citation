The analysis of Higgs boson couplings in the 2HDM(II) model motivates a deeper understanding of the Standard Model-like scenario because it can occur in both the Standard Model and other models, and resolving these cases is crucial for advancing our knowledge. This work extends our understanding by identifying patterns and deviations in Higgs boson couplings that can distinguish between the Standard Model and the 2HDM(II) model (hep-ph/0101208). [Motivation]
The analysis of Higgs boson couplings in the 2HDM(II) model extends our understanding of the Standard Model-like scenario by providing a pattern relation between the ratios of couplings to gauge bosons and quarks, allowing for the differentiation of various realizations of this scenario. This extends the prior method by enabling the calculation of loop couplings with increased accuracy and sensitivity to Higgs self-interaction parameters (hep-ph/0101208). [Extends]
