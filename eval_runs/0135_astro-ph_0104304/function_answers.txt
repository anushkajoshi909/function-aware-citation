The comparison of restricted N-body models with self-consistent N-body simulations informs future research on the interaction scenario between galaxies like NGC 4449 and DDO 125 by demonstrating the applicability of simple restricted N-body calculations. The restricted models are compared to self-consistent simulations on the basis of their ability to reproduce the main observational features of the galaxy interaction (astro-ph/0104304). [Compares]
The comparison of restricted N-body models with self-consistent N-body simulations informs future research by demonstrating the applicability of simple calculations and highlighting the need to investigate the origin of the extended HI disc around NGC 4449. Further study is required to clarify the origin of this disc, potentially involving previous interactions (astro-ph/0104304). [FutureWork]
