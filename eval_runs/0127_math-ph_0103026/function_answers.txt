Previous studies on non-linear parabolic equations have derived linearised equations for small perturbations about stationary solutions and analyzed the spectrum of the generator of time-evolution (math-ph/0103026). [Background]
The stability of stationary states in fluid dynamics, particularly for non-linear parabolic equations, remains uncertain due to the complexity of the operator governing time-evolution. Investigating the spectrum and properties of this operator, such as its potential non-sectorial nature, could provide crucial insights into the stability of these states (math-ph/0103026).
