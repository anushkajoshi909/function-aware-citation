The pseudo mode theory extends previous work by applying the Fano diagonalisation method to systems with structured reservoirs, allowing for the treatment of non-Markovian behavior in atomic systems with improved accuracy. This approach builds upon prior methods by enabling the use of Markovian master equations for systems with multiple excitations of the reservoir (quant-ph/0102142). [Extends]
The pseudo mode theory extends previous work by treating non-Markovian behavior in atomic systems through the Fano diagonalisation method, comparing to other methods by applying Markovian master equations for the atom-discrete quasimode system. It is compared to quasimode theory, which enables treatment of multiple excitation of the reservoir, on the basis of structured reservoirs and coupling constants (quant-ph/0102142). [Compares]
