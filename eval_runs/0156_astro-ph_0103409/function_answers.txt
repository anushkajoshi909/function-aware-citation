The current work extends previous studies by Spruit, Stehle & Papaloizou (1995) and the shearing sheet model, confirming the existence of the interchange instability and the stabilizing effect of shear in Keplerian discs. It also expands on these findings by identifying a global instability that transports angular momentum outward when magnetic forces significantly support the disc against gravity (astro-ph/0103409).

The current work extends previous studies by comparing the stability of poloidal magnetic fields in accretion discs with uniformly rotating and Keplerian rotation, finding that the latter is stabilized by shear unless magnetic forces significantly support against gravity. The results are compared to predictions from the shearing sheet model and the work of Spruit, Stehle & Papaloizou (1995), confirming the existence of the interchange instability and finding a new global instability (astro-ph/0103409).
