The researchers use a 2-D hydro code to study the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarfs, allowing them to examine multi-dimensional effects during the final hours prior to the explosion. This approach enables a detailed investigation of mixing and the ignition process, providing new insights into the explosive nuclear burning and flame propagation (astro-ph/0104226). [Uses]
