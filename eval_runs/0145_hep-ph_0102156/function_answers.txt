The RIMH models, arising from SUSY SO(10) grand unified theories, are compared to other approaches in terms of solving the SUSY flavor and CP problems, offering a promising way to reconcile naturalness with a decoupling solution. They are evaluated based on their ability to generate correct fermion masses and predict relic density and decay rates, which yield significant constraints on model parameter space (hep-ph/0102156).
