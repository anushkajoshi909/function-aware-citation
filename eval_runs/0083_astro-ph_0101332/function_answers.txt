The study of a two giant planet system's coupled evolution is motivated by the need to understand how the migration of planets is affected by the presence of multiple planets, which can lead to different outcomes compared to the one planet case. This is important because the interactions between planets and the disk can result in unexpected migration patterns, such as outward migration (astro-ph/0101332). [Motivation]
The study of a two giant planet system is motivated by its comparison to the one planet case in terms of migration, with the two planet system exhibiting outwards migration due to a positive differential Lindblad torque. This is in contrast to the one planet case, where the torques are proportional to the square of the planet mass, resulting in a different migration behavior (astro-ph/0101332). [Compares]
