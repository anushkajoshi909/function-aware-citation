The current work extends earlier predictions and phenomenological theories by confirming the collapse phase transition in four-dimensional interacting self-avoiding trails and suggesting it belongs to the same universality class as interacting self-avoiding walks. This extends the scope of the Lifshitz-Grosberg-Khokhlov theory to four dimensions and challenges the assumption that the upper critical dimension for interacting self-avoiding trails is $d_u=4$ (cond-mat/0104134).

The current work extends our understanding of the collapse phase transition in self-avoiding trails by confirming earlier predictions and phenomenological theories through simulations of interacting self-avoiding trails in four dimensions (cond-mat/0104134). [Background]
