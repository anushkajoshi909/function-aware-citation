The study of gas-phase abundances in the Magellanic Bridge is motivated by its significantly lower metallicity compared to Galactic halo clouds, despite showing similar relative gas-phase abundances. This discrepancy highlights the need to understand the interstellar medium in the Magellanic Bridge and its comparison to Galactic halo clouds (astro-ph/0101548). [Motivation]
The study of gas-phase abundances in the Magellanic Bridge is compared to Galactic halo clouds, with similarities found in relative abundances of certain elements despite lower metallicity in the Magellanic Bridge. The comparison is based on the relative gas-phase abundances of elements such as C II, N I, and O I with respect to S II (astro-ph/0101548). [Compares]
