The calculation of multi-loop master integrals was motivated by the need for a more efficient method, as the traditional approach was likely insufficient (hep-ph/0102033). [Background]
The calculation of multi-loop master integrals is hindered by the complexity of traditional methods, motivating the development of a new approach based on numerical solutions of difference equations. Understanding this new method requires background knowledge of integration-by-parts identities, factorial series, and Laplace transformation, as well as the reduction of Feynman integrals to master integrals (hep-ph/0102033).
