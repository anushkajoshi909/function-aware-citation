The extension of the Nonlinear Maxwell Theory in this paper suggests potential areas for future research by outlining a framework for transitioning from Classical Electrodynamics to Extended Electrodynamics, which may lead to new insights and applications. This extension builds upon prior methods by providing a new approach to formulating Maxwell equations, potentially increasing the scope and accuracy of electromagnetic theory (hep-th/0101137).

The extension of the Nonlinear Maxwell Theory in this paper suggests potential areas for future research by outlining the transition to Extended Electrodynamics and motivating the pursuit of the right extension of Maxwell equations. This implies that future work could involve further developing and exploring the properties of nonlinear vacuum solutions in Extended Electrodynamics (hep-th/0101137). [FutureWork]
