The current work extends our understanding of cosmic ray propagation by providing new constraints on diffusion parameters using high-precision cosmic ray nuclei flux measurements. It improves upon prior methods by including convection and reacceleration in the diffusion model, and by excluding models without these processes, thereby increasing the accuracy of propagation parameter estimates (astro-ph/0101231).
