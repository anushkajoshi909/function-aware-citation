The new calculation of photoionization of interstellar matter extends existing knowledge by incorporating directly observed radiation sources and modeling unobserved EUV emission to improve the accuracy of ionization and heating predictions within the Complex of Local Interstellar Clouds. This approach builds upon prior methods by including additional radiation sources and improving agreement with observational data on temperature, electron density, and gas phase abundances (astro-ph/0104234).
