The late-time behavior of a dynamically perturbed rapidly rotating black hole exhibits a unique oscillating "tail" with an amplitude that decays as 1/t at late times for extreme Kerr black holes (gr-qc/0103054). [Background]
The study of late-time behavior of dynamically perturbed rapidly rotating black holes suggests future research on constructing theoretical templates for detecting gravitational-wave signals from rapidly spinning black holes, which requires combining many quasinormal modes. Further investigation is needed to understand the implications of the long-lived oscillating "tail" in extreme black holes and its potential effects on gravitational-wave detection (gr-qc/0103054).
