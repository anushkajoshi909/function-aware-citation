The current work's approach to simulating relativistic jets is compared to previous theoretical models, which assume a magnetized plasma ejected from a supermassive black hole. The differences found suggest potential areas of future research, including the examination of non-linear effects on jet stability through numerical simulations (astro-ph/0103020). [Compares]
The current work's approach to simulating relativistic jets using numerical Monte Carlo methods differs from previous analytical methods by considering more general conditions, including turbulent and anisotropic situations. Future research may explore particle acceleration at shear layers in relativistic jets, which could provide new insights into the observed synchrotron spectra (astro-ph/0104120). [FutureWork]
