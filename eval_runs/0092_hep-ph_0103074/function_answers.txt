The current understanding of neutrino mass scenarios is being probed by experiments like Double Beta Decay, which can test degenerate neutrino mass scenarios and hot dark matter models (hep-ph/0103074). [Background]
The GENIUS experiment extends the scope of double beta decay experiments, such as the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment, to probe beyond Standard Model physics and test almost all neutrino mass scenarios. It also extends the accuracy of neutrino mass measurements, allowing for the exclusion of degenerate neutrino mass scenarios and probing cosmological models on the level of future satellite experiments (hep-ph/0102319).
