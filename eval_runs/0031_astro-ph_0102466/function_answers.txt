Future research could utilize the nonlinear correction methods and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) presented in this study to further investigate the power spectrum of density fluctuations by exploring deviations from the LCDM model and addressing spatial features of the data. This could involve fine-tuning theoretical and error models to better understand the observed wiggle in the power spectrum (astro-ph/0101361). [FutureWork]
