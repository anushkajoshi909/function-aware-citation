The two-fluid model of diffusive shock acceleration provides background information for understanding the production of energetic cosmic rays by simulating the acceleration of particles in highly relativistic shocks, which could be relevant to astrophysical sources such as AGNs and GRBs (astro-ph/0101245). [Background]
The two-fluid model of diffusive shock acceleration provides crucial background information for understanding the production of energetic cosmic rays by revealing the significant energy gain and acceleration speed-up that occur in highly relativistic shocks. This is important because it can help explain the origin of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) from sites such as Gamma Ray Bursts (astro-ph/0101245). [Motivation]
