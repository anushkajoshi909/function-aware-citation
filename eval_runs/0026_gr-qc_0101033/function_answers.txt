The general two-dimensional gravity model provides background information by elucidating its canonical form and solution in the massless case, which helps in understanding the derivation of the effective action (gr-qc/0101033). [Background]
The general two-dimensional gravity model is used to provide background information for understanding the effective action, which is then applied to reproduce known solutions, such as the Fisher and Roberts solutions. The model's equations of motion are solved to obtain the effective action for a scalar field, allowing for the exclusion of geometric fields (gr-qc/0101033). [Uses]
