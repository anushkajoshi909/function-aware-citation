The limitations of the current study on the Tully-Fisher relation and dark matter halos could motivate future research on galaxy-formation models and the distribution of halo spins. Further investigation into the variation of the Tully-Fisher relation with redshift could also be explored to constrain the redshift distribution of collapsing dark-matter halos and star-formation history (astro-ph/0102025). [Motivation]
Future research could investigate the variation of the Tully-Fisher relation with redshift to break parameter degeneracies among galactosynthesis models and constrain dark-matter halo properties. This could involve studying the redshift distribution of collapsing dark-matter halos and the star-formation history and baryon fraction in disk galaxies (astro-ph/0102025). [FutureWork]
