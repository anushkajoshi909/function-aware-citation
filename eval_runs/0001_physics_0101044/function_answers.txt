The methods used in this study, such as ab initio mixed-states and sum-over-states calculations, can be applied to future research on parity nonconserving electric dipole transition amplitudes to calculate these amplitudes to high accuracy. Researchers can utilize a hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach for this purpose, particularly if certain transition amplitudes are measured to high accuracy (physics/0101044). [Uses]
The methods used in this study can be applied to future research by utilizing a hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach to calculate parity nonconserving electric dipole transition amplitudes with high accuracy, particularly if key transition amplitudes are measured to high accuracy. Future work may focus on measuring these amplitudes to better than 1% accuracy to improve the overall accuracy of the calculations (physics/0101044). [FutureWork]
