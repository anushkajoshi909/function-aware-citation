Researchers use Imaging Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes to detect gamma rays from astrophysical objects, such as the Crab Nebula and Active Galaxies, in order to study particle acceleration mechanisms and place limits on the infra-red background. These telescopes are applied to distinguish between gamma-ray and cosmic-ray-induced air showers, informing the development of next-generation telescope facilities (astro-ph/0101533). [Uses]
The detection of gamma rays from astrophysical objects using Imaging Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes will inform future work on distinguishing between primary gamma rays and hadronic cosmic ray background, and on detecting phenomena such as neutralino annihilation and primordial black hole evaporation. The next generation of multi-national telescope facilities will target these phenomena and various astrophysical objects (astro-ph/0101533). [FutureWork]
