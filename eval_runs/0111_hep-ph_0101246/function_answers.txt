The limitations of current photon emission calculations in high-energy collisions motivate future research in precision measurements, particularly in the low and high energy regions. This research is necessary to improve the accuracy of total cross-section calculations, such as those for photon-photon processes (hep-ph/0104015). [Motivation]
Future research could be motivated by the limitations of current photon emission calculations, potentially focusing on QCD studies in two-photon interactions. This may involve exploring collider experiments, such as linear e+e- and gamma-gamma colliders (hep-ph/0101075). [FutureWork]
