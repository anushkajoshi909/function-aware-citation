The finding of a linear term in the dispersion relation is not mentioned, however, the observation of interference fringe depletion in Bose condensates motivates further study of the Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon. This work compares to existing studies by exploring the behavior of matter waves across the condensation threshold, shedding light on the underlying physics of this phase transition (cond-mat/0103602). [Motivation]
The current work's finding of a linear term in the dispersion relation is not mentioned, but the study's results using a modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation are compared to those of the standard Thomas-Fermi and Gross-Pitaevskii equations, showing large differences in column densities and half maximum radius. The comparison is based on the calculated column densities and radii in the large gas parameter regime (cond-mat/0101395). [Compares]
