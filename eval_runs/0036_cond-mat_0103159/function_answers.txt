The study of dimensional crossover in Hubbard ladders is motivated by a lack of understanding of the transition from 1D to 2D behavior, particularly in half-filled and lightly doped systems (cond-mat/0103159). [Background]
The current study is motivated by a lack of understanding of the dimensional crossover in Hubbard ladders, particularly the transition from 1D to 2D behavior in half-filled and lightly doped systems. Background information on the Hubbard model and renormalization group techniques is necessary to understand this phenomenon, which exhibits complex behavior including odd-even effects and phase transitions (cond-mat/0103159).
