The current work compares to previous research by extending the analysis of fermion-pair and photon-pair production in e+e- collisions to the full LEP2 data set, setting more stringent lower limits on new physics phenomena. The results are compared to Standard Model expectations, with no significant deviations observed, and are used to constrain the scales of contact interactions, low gravity effective Planck scale, and string models (hep-ex/0103039).
