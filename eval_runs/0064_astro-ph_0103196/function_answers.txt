Current understanding of supernova explosions is limited by the inability of spherical models to reproduce explosions, even with accurate neutrino transport, highlighting the need for multi-dimensional simulations and better understanding of neutrino interactions. This gap in knowledge motivates further research to resolve the discrepancies and improve our comprehension of these complex astrophysical phenomena (astro-ph/0103015). [Motivation]
Further research is needed to overcome the limitations of current spherical models, which fail to produce explosions even with accurate neutrino transport. Future work may involve multi-dimensional hydrodynamics, general relativity, and improved understanding of neutrino interactions in neutron star matter to better comprehend supernova explosions and their interactions with the circumstellar medium (astro-ph/0103015).
