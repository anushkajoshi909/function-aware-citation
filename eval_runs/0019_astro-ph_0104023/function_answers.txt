Future studies can extend the current work's method by applying it to a wider range of galaxy samples and cosmological models, increasing the accuracy and scope of the analysis. The method developed by Jing, Mo, & BÃ¶rner (1998) can be further refined to account for the morphological mixture of galaxies and improve the modeling of pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion at small separations (astro-ph/0104023).

Future studies can extend the current work by addressing uncertainties in cosmological parameters and galaxy formation processes to better understand galaxy biasing. The field is expected to be led by observational developments that allow model parameters to be tuned and scenarios to be falsified (astro-ph/0103017). [FutureWork]
