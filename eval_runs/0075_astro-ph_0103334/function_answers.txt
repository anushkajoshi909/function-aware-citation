The investigation of magnetic field fluctuations in the NGC 7538 region is motivated by the observed differences in polarization between two prominent cores, suggesting varying evolutionary stages and magnetic field structures. The observations of polarization are used to understand these fluctuations, which are thought to have developed during the formation of substructures in the more evolved core (astro-ph/0103334). [Motivation]
The SCUBA Polarimeter is used to obtain imaging polarimetry of the 0.85mm continuum emission in the NGC 7538 region to understand magnetic field fluctuations. The observations of polarization are used to interpret thermal radiation by magnetically aligned dust grains and derive the distribution of magnetic field directions (astro-ph/0103334). [Uses]
