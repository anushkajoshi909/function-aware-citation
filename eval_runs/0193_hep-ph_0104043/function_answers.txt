The current work builds on a previous theoretical framework for three neutrino mixing in matter, where rigorous analytical solutions were obtained (hep-ph/0104043). [Background]
The development of a new approximate method for studying three flavor neutrino oscillations in matter is motivated by the need for a simpler approach to handle varying matter density profiles. This work builds on previous research by introducing a semi-classical approximation that replaces multiple evolution operators with a single one, applicable to matter density profiles with minimal fluctuations (hep-ph/0103252).
