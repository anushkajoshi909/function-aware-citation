This work extends previous methods for determining metallicity and age in galaxies by exploring the use of the rest-frame near-UV spectral region to lift the degeneracy between age and metallicity, motivated by the limitation of previous methods in accurately estimating these parameters. The extension improves the accuracy of age estimates, particularly for high-redshift galaxies, by allowing metallicity to vary as a free parameter in model fitting (astro-ph/0103450). [Extends]
The current work extends previous methods by exploring the use of the rest-frame near-UV spectral region to break the age-metallicity degeneracy in galaxies, motivated by the limitation of previous methods in accurately determining metallicity and age. This extension is necessary because previous methods struggled to lift this degeneracy, making it difficult to constrain the ages of galaxies (astro-ph/0103450). [Motivation]
