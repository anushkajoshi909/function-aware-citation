The current work extends previous research on magnetospheric accretion by applying it to the specific case of RW Aur A, interpreting its observed features within a non-axisymmetric framework. This approach builds upon prior methods by considering asymmetries induced by either orbital motion of a secondary object or rotational modulation of a single star with an inclined magnetosphere (astro-ph/0102137).

The current work applies the concept of non-axisymmetric magnetospheric accretion to interpret the observed features of RW Aur A, building on previous research in this area. This framework is used to explain the periodic modulations and variations in spectral features, with two possible models considered to account for the observed asymmetry (astro-ph/0102137). [Uses]
