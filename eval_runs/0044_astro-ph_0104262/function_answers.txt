The effects of irradiation on planetary atmospheres in this study are compared to models that do not include impinging radiation, showing large errors in thermal and reflected flux. The results are also consistent with recently reported upper limit values for planet-to-star brightness ratios, such as those for tau bootis (astro-ph/0104262). [Compares]
The effects of irradiation on planetary atmospheres in this study differ from other models that do not account for impinging radiation in a self-consistent manner, which can result in large errors (astro-ph/0104262). [Background]
