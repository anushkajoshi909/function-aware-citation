The current work's understanding of electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves compares to previous thoughts in that it reveals a more complex structure, including both density enhancements and depletions, whereas previous work considered only density depletions. This reexamination was motivated by the limitation of previous work in understanding the physical roles of trapped and passing electrons in these solitary waves (physics/0103020). [Compares]
Previous thoughts on electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves were limited by the assumption that they consisted only of density depletion, and the current work reexamines this concept to provide a more accurate understanding. The motivation for this reexamination stems from the need to resolve the limitations and inaccuracies in previous work, particularly regarding the role of trapped and passing electrons and the shielding of the positive core (physics/0103020).
