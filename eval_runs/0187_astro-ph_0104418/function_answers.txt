The methods used in the current work are compared to those of previous redshift surveys, such as the CfA and SDSS surveys, in terms of their ability to understand large-scale structure, with newer surveys like the VLT/VIRMOS and Keck/DEIMOS projects offering improvements in precision and scope. These newer surveys are expected to surpass previous ones by an order of magnitude in size and precision (astro-ph/0104418). [Compares]
The current work uses redshift surveys, such as the 2DF and SDSS surveys, to understand large-scale structure in the Universe, similar to previous surveys like the CfA redshift survey. These surveys are applied to collect spectra of galaxies and measure clustering, with newer surveys like VLT/VIRMOS and Keck/DEIMOS aiming to improve precision and extend measurements to the distant Universe (astro-ph/0104418).
