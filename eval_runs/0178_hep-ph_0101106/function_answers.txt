The current work on CP-violating phases can be extended by exploring the measurement of these phases at a future linear collider, building on prior methods by increasing the precision of phase determination and introducing CP-odd kinematical variables. This extension improves the accuracy of phase measurement, such as determining $\phi_1$ to a precision of $\pi/30$, and efficiency in identifying CP violation, albeit with challenges due to small CP asymmetries (hep-ph/0101106).

The current work on CP-violating phases can be extended by exploring the measurement of these phases at a future linear collider, where the determination of certain phases and model parameters can be achieved with high precision. Further research directions include overcoming the challenge of experimentally observing the predicted small CP asymmetries (hep-ph/0101106). [FutureWork]
