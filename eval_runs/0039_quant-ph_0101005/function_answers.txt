Current understanding of quantum communication and entanglement is limited by the fact that quantum communication cannot exceed classical communication efficiency without entanglement, and entanglement alone is useless for information transmission (quant-ph/0101005). [Background]
The need to reduce the amount of entanglement required for reliable quantum communication motivates further research, as current methods are limited by the resources needed to establish entanglement over noisy channels. This limitation hinders the potential of quantum communication to enhance classical communication efficiency (quant-ph/0103023). [Motivation]
