The properties of host galaxies of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, including their masses and structural parameters, provide a foundation for understanding the origin of radio loudness (astro-ph/0103238). [Background]
The origin of radio loudness remains a long-standing problem that may be resolved through further host-galaxy studies, particularly investigating the relationship between black-hole mass and accretion efficiency. Future research should focus on the role of black-hole mass and accretion efficiency in determining radio loudness, with a specific direction being the examination of black-hole masses greater than 10^9 solar masses (astro-ph/0103238).
