The current study's methodology extends previous work by Braun & Burton through the use of high-resolution filled-aperture and synthesis data from the Arecibo telescope, allowing for more accurate determination of the intrinsic properties of compact high-velocity clouds. This approach is compared to previous cataloging efforts, providing a more detailed understanding of the morphology and properties of these clouds (astro-ph/0102085). [Compares]
The current study extends previous cataloging work by Braun & Burton by providing high-resolution imaging of compact high-velocity clouds using the Arecibo telescope, allowing for a more detailed understanding of their morphology and properties. This approach improves upon earlier work by enabling the detection and resolution of halos surrounding the clouds, and by providing estimates of distance and other intrinsic properties (astro-ph/0102085).
