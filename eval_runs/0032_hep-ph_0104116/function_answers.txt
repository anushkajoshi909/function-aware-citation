The 2-3 symmetry motivates a deeper understanding of the neutrino mass matrix by providing a framework that explains maximum mixing in atmospheric neutrino oscillation and predicts the vanishing of a specific MNS matrix element. This symmetry is significant because it makes testable predictions that can be verified or falsified by future experiments, particularly regarding the neutrino mass hierarchy and the value of the electron-neutrino mass (hep-ph/0104116). [Motivation]
The 2-3 symmetry extends our understanding of the neutrino mass matrix by providing a framework that predicts maximum mixing in atmospheric neutrino oscillation and vanishing of the MNS matrix element $U_{e3}$, which is consistent with existing experimental results. This symmetry also extends prior results by introducing a novel mass lower bound for the electron-neutrino, which can be tested by future experiments (hep-ph/0104116). [Extends]
