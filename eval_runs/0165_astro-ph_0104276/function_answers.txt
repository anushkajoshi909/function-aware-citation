The current understanding of Population III star formation can be extended through numerical simulations that investigate the collapse and fragmentation of primordial gas. These simulations raise new questions and provide a foundation for future research to better constrain the initial mass function of these stars (astro-ph/0103382). [Extends]
Further research is needed to extend the current understanding of Population III star formation, and future studies should investigate the collapse and fragmentation of primordial gas to better constrain the initial mass function of these stars. The results of recent numerical simulations have raised new questions that must be addressed in future work (astro-ph/0103382). [FutureWork]
