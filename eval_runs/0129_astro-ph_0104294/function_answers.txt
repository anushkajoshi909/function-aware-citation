The discovery of high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ sources motivates a deeper understanding of chemically primitive galaxies in the early universe because it sheds light on the formation and evolution of galaxy-like objects. This understanding is crucial as it reveals the building blocks that merged to form normal galaxies today (astro-ph/0104308). [Motivation]
The discovery of high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ sources extends our understanding of chemically primitive galaxies by providing a direct constraint on galaxy formation models, particularly the distribution of infalling cold gas during the early stages of galaxy formation. This extends prior methods by offering a means to detect and characterize the "fuzz" of extended Lyman alpha emission around young quasars, thereby shedding light on the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early universe (astro-ph/0101174).
