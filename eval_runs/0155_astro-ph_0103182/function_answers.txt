The hard steady states of GRS 1915+105 can be categorized into two distinct types based on their X-ray spectral and timing properties (astro-ph/0103182). [Background]
The study of distinct types of hard steady states in GRS 1915+105 provides a foundation for understanding the underlying accretion flow, suggesting avenues for future research into the connection between Comptonizing electrons and compact radio jets. Further investigation is needed to explore the relationship between accretion flow models and the observed X-ray and radio properties (astro-ph/0104067). [FutureWork]
