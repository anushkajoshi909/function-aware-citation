The spectroscopic survey of faint lensed galaxies in the core of the galaxy cluster AC114 extends the work of Natarajan et al by confirming predicted lensing redshifts and discovering new multiple-image systems, increasing the sensitivity towards low-luminosity high-redshift objects. This extension improves the accuracy of the mass model and provides a method to probe the faint end of the luminosity function of high-redshift galaxies (astro-ph/0104477). [Extends]
The spectroscopic survey of faint lensed galaxies in the core of the galaxy cluster AC114 extends the work of Natarajan et al by confirming predicted lensing redshifts and discovering new multiple-image systems, which motivates further research on the faint end of the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies. This is important because it allows for a large gain in sensitivity towards low luminosity high-z objects, enabling a better understanding of the high redshift Universe (astro-ph/0104477).
