This work extends previous research on quantum field theories by providing a simple, bosonic model that captures key properties of gauge theories with Higgs fields, overcoming limitations in earlier studies that relied on supersymmetry. The model improves upon earlier approaches by allowing for the explicit study of supersymmetry breaking and providing a framework for understanding the gauge theory/string theory correspondence (hep-th/0102041). [Extends]
The current work extends previous research on quantum field theories by exploring their formulation as effective field theories, motivated by limitations in earlier studies that prompt a reevaluation of reductionism in science. This extension matters because it offers a new perspective on the debate surrounding reductionism, emergence, and inter-level relationships (physics/0101039). [Motivation]
