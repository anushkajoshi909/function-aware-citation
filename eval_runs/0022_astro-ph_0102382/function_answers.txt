The current work extends our understanding of the Galactic Center by reviewing the main observational characteristics and recent high-energy observations, building on previous studies of the massive black hole's existence and activity. It refines the understanding of the 3 million solar mass black hole coincident with Sgr A*, addressing its physical condition and apparent lack of high-energy activity (astro-ph/0102382). [Extends]
The current work compares the black hole and fermion ball scenarios of the Galactic Center by analyzing the orbits of stars S0-1 and S0-2, showing that both scenarios are consistent with the data. The comparison is based on the allowed phase-space of the stars' velocity and distance to Sgr A*, which is found to be larger for the fermion ball scenario than for the black hole scenario (astro-ph/0103466).
