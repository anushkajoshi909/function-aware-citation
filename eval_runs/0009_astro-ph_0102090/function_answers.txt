The current work's method of deriving the color-magnitude relation is compared to previous models based on the observed number counts in the J and Ks bands. It uses deep VLT-ISAAC images of the Chandra Deep Field and Hubble Deep Field-South to compare its results with model predictions, particularly those based on a small amount of merging in a specific cosmology (astro-ph/0104284).

The current work uses a sample of 48 giant early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster with CCD observations in the U- and V-band to derive the color-magnitude relation. This derivation is based on color measurements within an aperture equal to the galaxy's effective radius, differing from traditional methods that use fixed apertures (astro-ph/0102090). [Uses]
