The study of R Coronae Borealis stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud is motivated by the unknown absolute luminosities of Galactic RCB stars, which can be determined using the LMC stars as a reference. The MACHO project photometry database is utilized to discover new RCB stars and estimate their properties, ultimately informing our understanding of these stars in the Galaxy (astro-ph/0102262).
