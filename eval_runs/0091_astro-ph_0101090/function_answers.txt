The observed radial velocity of the Local Interstellar Cloud is compared to previous predictions by Lallement & Bertin and Lallement et al., showing a discrepancy of 2.9 km/s. The proposal to extend the Hyades Cloud boundary is motivated by comparisons with previous HST and ground-based observations of nearby stars (astro-ph/0101090). [Compares]
The observed radial velocity of the Local Interstellar Cloud is lower than previously predicted, suggesting compression or deceleration at its leading edge. This discrepancy, along with previous observations of nearby stars, motivates the proposal to extend the Hyades Cloud boundary (astro-ph/0101090). [Motivation]
