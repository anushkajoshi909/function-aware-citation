Researchers can use the method of polarisation conversion of electromagnetic waves in 2D electron systems to achieve high polarisation conversion efficiency in polarisation spectroscopy applications. This method can be applied to study 2D electron systems, such as those on GaAs, by exciting cyclotron-polaritons to greatly increase resonance polarisation conversion (cond-mat/0101072). [Uses]
The method of polarisation conversion of electromagnetic waves in 2D electron systems can be used in future research for polarisation spectroscopy applications by exploiting the high polarisation conversion efficiency under cyclotron resonance conditions. Further studies can explore the potential of this phenomenon in polarisation spectroscopy of 2D electron systems (cond-mat/0101072). [FutureWork]
