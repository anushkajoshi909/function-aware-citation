The extension of the semiclassical model of the collective atomic recoil laser was motivated by the need to include quantum mechanical effects, particularly for cases where the average atomic momentum is less than the recoil momentum. The semiclassical CARL model is used as a foundation, with its equations reducing to the Maxwell-Bloch equations under certain conditions, and its results recovered in the limit of large average photon scattering per atom (cond-mat/0102360). [Motivation]
The extension of the semiclassical model of the collective atomic recoil laser was motivated by the limitation of not accounting for quantum effects in the center-of-mass motion of atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. The Maxwell-Bloch equations for two momentum levels are used in this extension to describe the behavior of the collective atomic recoil laser when the average atomic momentum is less than the recoil momentum (cond-mat/0102360).
