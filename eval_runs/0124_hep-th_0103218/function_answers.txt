The concept of discrete scalar fields is compared to existing theories such as MOND and Tsallis statistics, with the discrete scalar field potentially providing a physical basis for MOND and being related to Tsallis statistics as a proper description for discrete-interaction systems. The discrete field is also contrasted with continuous fields, with discrepancies between the two descriptions observable far from a critical point where they are equivalent (hep-th/0103218). [Compares]
The concept of discrete scalar fields utilizes MOND by providing a potential physical basis through the introduction of an effective-acceleration scale. Discrete scalar fields also relate to Tsallis statistics, which is considered suitable for describing discrete-interaction systems (hep-th/0103218). [Uses]
