Source crowding in astrometric measurements poses a significant problem, inducing positional errors even for bright targets, which motivates the development of new methods to improve measurement accuracy. Further work can focus on refining techniques like spectral decomposition to enhance the precision of astrometric measurements in crowded fields (astro-ph/0101217). [Motivation]
