The study of KK graviton self-interactions at a future Graviton Factory extends our understanding of the 5-d Randall-Sundrum model by probing the accuracy of the 5-d Einstein gravity picture and yielding indirect information on the self-coupling of the 4-d graviton. This extends prior results by allowing for the measurement of decays of heavier states to lighter ones, which can be sensitive to higher derivative operators and provide insight into the 5-d fermion mass matrix (hep-ph/0104199).
