The detection rates of beamed Magnetar Flares are compared to other gamma-ray bursts, such as Class II GRBs, on the basis of their luminosity and distance. Beamed Magnetar Flares could be detected out to redshift z ~ 0.1, potentially accounting for a subset of short, hard Class II gamma-ray bursts (astro-ph/0103235). [Compares]
Future research could explore the possibility that beamed Magnetar Flares account for short, hard Class II gamma-ray bursts, investigating whether their positions correlate with galaxies and galaxy clusters within 350 Mpc. This could involve analyzing the detection rates and characteristics of beamed Magnetar Flares in relation to other gamma-ray bursts to confirm or rule out this hypothesis (astro-ph/0103235).
