The investigation of MgB$_2$ is motivated by its unique electronic properties, which set it apart from other diborides due to its strong charge anisotropy at the boron site. This distinct characteristic makes MgB$_2$ an interesting subject for study, particularly in comparison to other diborides (cond-mat/0104346). [Motivation]
The investigation of MgB$_2$ is motivated by its unique electronic properties, which are compared to those of other diborides like AlB$_2$ in terms of charge transfer and band structure. MgB$_2$ is compared to AlB$_2$ and graphite through x-ray emission spectra, showing distinct charge transfer characteristics that contribute to its high-T$_c$ behavior (cond-mat/0103487). [Compares]
