The current work uses near-infrared coronagraphic imaging to study the circumstellar disk around TW Hydrae, a classical T Tauri star. This method is applied to derive disk properties, such as mass and inner radius, and compare them with those of disks around classical T Tauri stars in more distant molecular clouds (astro-ph/0103458). [Uses]
The current work compares its near-infrared imaging results of the circumstellar disk around TW Hydrae to previous images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Array, finding agreement in disk morphology. The derived disk properties are also compared to those of disks around classical T Tauri stars in more distant molecular clouds, showing similar characteristics (astro-ph/0103458). [Compares]
