The coarsening behaviors of CD models on EW, KPZ, and GBDT surfaces are compared, with analysis based on the distribution of particle cluster sizes, 2-point spatial correlation functions, and density-density correlation functions. The comparison reveals differences in the exponent values, such as Î±, indicating distinct coarsening behaviors on different surfaces (cond-mat/0102521). [Compares]
The authors use analytic and numerical methods to analyze the coarsening behaviors of CD models on different surfaces, including Edwards-Wilkinson and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang surfaces. They apply the independent interval approximation to derive a relationship between the exponents describing the distribution of particle cluster sizes and the spatial correlation function (cond-mat/0102521).
