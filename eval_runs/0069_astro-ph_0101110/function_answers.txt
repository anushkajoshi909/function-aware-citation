The discovery of the 29 keV Cyclotron Resonant Scattering Feature in 4U 0352+309 extends previous research on X-ray pulsars by applying established spectral analysis methods to a low-luminosity pulsar. This work improves upon prior spectral fits by incorporating a CRSF, increasing the accuracy of the model for this specific type of X-ray pulsar (astro-ph/0101110). [Extends]
Researchers use the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer to analyze the X-ray spectrum of 4U 0352+309, applying established spectral models and discovering a Cyclotron Resonant Scattering Feature. The team utilizes continuum models, including a blackbody and power-law, to fit the observations and improve them with the addition of a CRSF at ~29 keV (astro-ph/0101110). [Uses]
