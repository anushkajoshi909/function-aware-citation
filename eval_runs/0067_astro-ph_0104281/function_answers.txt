The X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151, being one of the flattest among Seyfert galaxies, motivates the development of a two-phase model as it suggests the presence of two gas phases in pressure equilibrium. This spectrum deviates from expected spectra for Seyfert galaxies, prompting a re-examination of the narrow-line region's structure (astro-ph/0104281). [Motivation]
The X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 is compared to expected spectra for Seyfert galaxies, with its flat spectrum suggesting the presence of two gas phases in pressure equilibrium. This is in contrast to typical Seyfert galaxies, which do not exhibit such flat X-ray spectra, motivating the development of a two-phase model for NGC 4151's narrow-line region (astro-ph/0104281).
