The study of Hercules X-1 in an anomalous low state extends our understanding of X-ray binary systems by providing insight into the behavior of these systems when the direct X-ray emission is blocked, revealing a reflected spectrum from the companion star. This extends prior methods by allowing the reconstruction of the incident X-rays and understanding of the system's geometry and emission mechanisms (astro-ph/0101417). [Extends]
The study of Hercules X-1 in an anomalous low state builds on observations during its short-high state, providing context for understanding X-ray binary systems (astro-ph/0102100). [Background]
