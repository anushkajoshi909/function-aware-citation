Researchers utilize the three-flavor-index representation of effective baryon fields and a decomposition of corrections in terms of effective one-, two-, and three-quark operators to analyze the structure of meson loop corrections in HBChPT. This structural analysis can be applied to other problems in HBChPT to determine significant parts of the loop corrections (hep-ph/0104197). [Uses]
The structural analysis of meson loop corrections in HBChPT can be used in future research to determine significant loop corrections in various settings by utilizing the three-flavor-index representation of effective baryon fields and decomposition of corrections into effective quark operators. This analysis can be generalized to other problems in HBChPT (hep-ph/0104197). [FutureWork]
