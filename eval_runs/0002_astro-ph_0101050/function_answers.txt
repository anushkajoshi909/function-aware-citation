The study of NGC 3065 is motivated by its X-ray properties, and understanding its classification as a LINER with broad, variable Balmer lines requires background knowledge of active galactic nuclei and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (astro-ph/0101050). [Background]
The study of NGC 3065 is motivated by its unique X-ray properties, which led to the discovery of its LINER classification with broad, variable Balmer lines. Understanding its classification requires background information on the characteristics of LINERs and active galactic nuclei, as well as the properties of accretion disks and black holes (astro-ph/0101050).
