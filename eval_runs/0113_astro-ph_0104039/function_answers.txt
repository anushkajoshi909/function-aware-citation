The discovery of a subparsec-scale dense plasma torus around an active galactic nucleus provides insight into the accretion process, suggesting a transition from radial to rotational accretion (astro-ph/0104039). [Background]
The discovery of a subparsec-scale dense plasma torus around an active galactic nucleus suggests a transition from radial to rotational accretion, warranting further research on the interplay between these accretion modes. Future studies may investigate the dynamics of this transition and its implications for our understanding of the accretion process (astro-ph/0104039). [FutureWork]
