The current study extends our understanding of the relationship between mass-loss rates and crystalline silicate features in AGB stars by showing that low mass-loss rate objects may also form crystalline silicates, contrary to previous interpretations of ISO observations. This is achieved by introducing an alternative explanation based on radiative transfer calculations that account for temperature differences between amorphous and crystalline silicates (astro-ph/0101256).

The current study builds on ISO observations by exploring an alternative explanation for the absence of crystalline silicate features in low mass-loss rate AGB stars (astro-ph/0101256). [Background]
