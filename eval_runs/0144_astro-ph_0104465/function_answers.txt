The results of this study compare to previous models of the Milky Way by suggesting a more massive and extended dark matter halo, consistent with hierarchical models of galaxy formation. The findings on dark matter halo shapes and Galactic constants imply that only dwarfs with high central dark matter densities can survive for 10 Gyr near the Milky Way, differing from previous models that may not account for such tidal interactions (astro-ph/0103430).
