The current work extends existing models by analyzing the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) with baryon and lepton number violation, building on the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) to study the renormalization group evolution and infrared stable fixed points. It improves the accuracy of the analysis by considering the effects of baryon and lepton number violation on the Yukawa couplings and soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings (hep-ph/0103005).

The researchers use renormalization group equations to analyze the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model with baryon and lepton number violation, studying the evolution and fixed points of Yukawa couplings and soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings. They apply this method to determine bounds on baryon number violating couplings and soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings (hep-ph/0103005). [Uses]
