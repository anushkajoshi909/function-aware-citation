The concept of homogeneity in cosmology informs its understanding of galaxy distribution by assuming an almost-perfect random gaussian field as the initial density field (astro-ph/0101143). [Background]
The trispectrum of the galaxy density field is used to differentiate between gaussian and non-gaussian models of structure formation. This method builds on previous results by utilizing the statistical properties of the initial density field to inform the understanding of galaxy distribution (astro-ph/0101143). [Uses]
