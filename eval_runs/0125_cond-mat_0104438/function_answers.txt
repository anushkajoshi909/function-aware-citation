The current work extends Ewald's method by generalizing it to calculate the anisotropic interaction between electrons in a Wigner crystal, allowing for more accurate energy calculations that take into account the crystal's orientation. This extension enables the consideration of piezoelectric effects and their impact on the total energy of the electron crystal (cond-mat/0104438). [Extends]
The current work uses a generalization of Ewald's method to calculate the anisotropic interaction between electrons in a Wigner crystal, taking into account the piezoelectric correction to the electrostatic interaction. This method is applied to calculate the energy of bilayer Wigner crystals in various orientations and layer distances (cond-mat/0104438). [Uses]
