The new self-interaction correction method builds upon existing density functional theory methods, specifically the local-density approximation, but introduces unphysical oscillations in high energy photoionization calculations. It extends prior methods by attempting to correct self-interaction errors, but with limited success due to generated spurious oscillations (physics/0103032). [Extends]
The new self-interaction correction method builds upon existing density functional theory methods, specifically the local-density approximation, to describe the ground state of metal clusters. Researchers use self-interaction correction within this framework to improve the description, but also compare it to non-local Hartree-Fock methods (physics/0103032). [Uses]
