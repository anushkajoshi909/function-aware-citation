The limitations of M-theory, including the lack of a complete background-independent formulation, motivate future research directions. Developing a more comprehensive understanding of M-theory and matrix theory is crucial for reconciling gravity and quantum field theory in a realistic framework (hep-th/0101126). [Motivation]
