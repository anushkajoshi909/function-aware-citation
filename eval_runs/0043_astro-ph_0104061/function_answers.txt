This study extends previous work by analyzing the X-ray spectra of optically selected Seyfert 2 galaxies, revealing complex spectra and cases with no intrinsic absorption, which challenges the typical understanding of these galaxies. The findings build upon earlier research by suggesting alternative explanations for the observed spectra, such as the presence of circumnuclear starbursts or scattered emission from warm absorbers (astro-ph/0104061).

The current X-ray spectral analysis of Seyfert 2 galaxies extends previous work by revealing similarities with narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and suggesting strong star formation, motivating further investigation into the nature of these galaxies. This work is important because it highlights differences in X-ray properties between Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies, particularly in relation to interaction strength and star formation (astro-ph/0101184).
