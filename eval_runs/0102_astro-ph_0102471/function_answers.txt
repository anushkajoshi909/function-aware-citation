The inability to detect the predicted TeV gamma-ray flux from supernova remnants motivates further research, highlighting limitations in current understanding. These limitations include issues with particle injection, maximum energy, and spectral index, which suggest a need for more realistic models and numerical techniques (astro-ph/0101175). [Motivation]
The limitations in identifying gamma-ray sources, such as understanding the mechanisms of gamma-ray emission from supernova remnants, motivate further research. Future work may focus on investigating properties like pulsar-driven nebulae and nonthermal X-ray emission to better understand these sources (astro-ph/0104348). [FutureWork]
