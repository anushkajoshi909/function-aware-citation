The mass function of open clusters is not well understood, particularly at lower masses, due to limitations such as strong background irregularities, dynamical evolution, and interaction with the Galactic field (astro-ph/0101371). [Background]
The current understanding of the mass function of open clusters is limited, motivating further study to better determine cluster properties and test evolution and dynamical theories. This knowledge gap is significant because it hinders the ability to establish observational constraints on the initial-final mass relationship and upper mass limit to white dwarf production (astro-ph/0104163).
