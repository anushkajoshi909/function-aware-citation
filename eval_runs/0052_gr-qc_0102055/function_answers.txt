The identification of Hilbert's error motivates a re-examination of black holes because it reveals a flaw in the historical understanding of point masses, which is crucial for understanding Schwarzschild's result and its implications for black hole physics. This error matters because it leads to a fundamentally different spacetime structure, one that is analytically extendible and contains a black hole (gr-qc/0102055). [Motivation]
The identification of Hilbert's error extends Schwarzschild's result by revealing that the space-time is analytically extendible, containing a black hole, whereas Hilbert's incorrect assertion led to a different boundary. This extension improves the understanding of black holes by showing that the Kruskal-Fronsdal black hole is a consequence of Hilbert's mistake (gr-qc/0102055). [Extends]
