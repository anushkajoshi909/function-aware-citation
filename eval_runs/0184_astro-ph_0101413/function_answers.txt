The current work extends previous research on cosmic microwave background anisotropies by analyzing the MAXIMA-1 data to smaller angular scales, building on the original analysis that covered a limited multipole range. The extension is achieved by utilizing data from specific photometers and a higher-resolution pixel size, allowing for an improved analysis up to a multipole of 1235 (astro-ph/0104459). [Extends]
The current work uses recently published high-quality data of cosmic microwave background anisotropies to study the dependence of cosmological parameters on initial conditions. This data is utilized to determine the best fit values and allowed parameter range for generic initial conditions (astro-ph/0104017). [Uses]
