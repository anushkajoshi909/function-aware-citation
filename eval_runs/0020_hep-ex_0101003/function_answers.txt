The experimental challenges of measuring muon polarization in kaon decay processes motivate future research in this area, which is crucial for understanding T-violation and its physics implications. Further studies on polarization measurements are needed to advance our knowledge in this field (hep-ex/0103007). [Motivation]
Future research directions include detailed examinations of muon polarization in KMU3 and radiative KMU2 decays, as well as measurements of T-violating polarization with high sensitivity to probe new physics (hep-ex/0101003). [FutureWork]
