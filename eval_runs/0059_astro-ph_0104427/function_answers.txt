The current work compares to previous research by extending the understanding of the magnetic state in doped SrB$_{6}$ through calculations for larger supercells and lower doping levels. It builds upon previous findings by demonstrating the persistence of a weak ferromagnetic state at lower doping levels, with a magnetic moment of approximately 0.1 $\mu_B$ per La impurity (cond-mat/0103180).

The current work extends previous research by demonstrating that the weak ferromagnetic state in slightly doped SrB$_{6}$ persists at even lower doping levels. It builds upon prior findings by showing that the magnetic state can be understood through charge transfer and potential energy gain, with a moment of approximately 0.1 $\mu_B$ per La impurity (cond-mat/0103180).
