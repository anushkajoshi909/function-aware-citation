The study of the exclusive decay of heavy quarkonium into a photon and two pions is motivated by the potential to gain insight into how gluons are converted into pions and to study s-wave ππ scattering (hep-ph/0103225). [Background]
The study of the exclusive decay of heavy quarkonium into a photon and two pions is motivated by the potential to gain insight into how gluons are converted into pions and to provide a unique approach to studying s-wave ππ scattering. Understanding this process requires background information on nonperturbative effects in heavy quarkonium and the distribution amplitude of two gluons in the isoscalar pion pair (hep-ph/0103225).
