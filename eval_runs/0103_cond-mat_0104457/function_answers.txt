The Migdal-Eliashberg theory has limitations, as evidenced by its incompatibility with experimental data of Rb$_3$C$_{60}$, which requires extremely large electron-phonon couplings that violate Migdal's theorem (cond-mat/0104457). [Background]
The Migdal-Eliashberg theory's inability to explain the experimental data of Rb$_3$C$_{60}$ with reasonable electron-phonon coupling values suggests a need for future work in generalizing the theory of superconductivity, particularly in the nonadiabatic regime. This generalization is necessary to account for the experimental properties of fullerides that strongly violate Migdal's theorem (cond-mat/0104457). [FutureWork]
