The study of microlensed sources through spectroscopy is motivated by the need to understand the kinematics of the Galactic bulge and the effects of extinction on these sources. It uses spectroscopic observations from the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph to derive radial velocities and extinctions of microlensed sources (astro-ph/0101092). [Motivation]
The spectroscopic study of microlensed sources is motivated by the opportunity to study the Galactic bulge's kinematics and extinction effects. Researchers use the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Kurucz model spectra to derive radial velocities and extinctions of microlensed sources (astro-ph/0101092). [Uses]
