Simulations are used to predict the X-ray surface brightness distribution from diffuse gas, which can inform future research on the X-ray luminosity of starburst galaxies by providing a basis for understanding the contribution of diffuse gas to the observed X-ray background. The simulations are applied to compute the mean background and its sensitivity to resolution, and to examine the effects of non-gravitational heating on the X-ray surface brightness distribution (astro-ph/0101467).

The methods used in this study can inform future research on the X-ray luminosity of starburst galaxies by investigating the nature of the additional emission component required to explain the observed hard X-ray emission in some systems. Future work should explore the implications of this additional emission for the contribution of starbursts to the cosmic X-ray background (astro-ph/0103484). [FutureWork]
