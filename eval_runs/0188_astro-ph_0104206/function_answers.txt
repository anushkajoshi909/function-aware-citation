The re-examination of global axisymmetric stability is motivated by the potential for magnetorotational instabilities to occur in flows that are hydrodynamically stable according to Rayleigh's criterion (astro-ph/0104206). [Background]
The re-examination of global axisymmetric stability is motivated by the need to understand magnetorotational instabilities in flows that are hydrodynamically stable, which is crucial for astrophysical applications. Background information on Rayleigh's criterion and previous work on the Rayleigh-unstable regime is necessary to understand this re-examination (astro-ph/0104206). [Motivation]
