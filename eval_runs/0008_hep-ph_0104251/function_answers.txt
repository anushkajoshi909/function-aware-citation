The thesis extends the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model by relaxing the imposed R-parity, allowing for R-parity violating contributions. This extension enables the exploration of new phenomenological features, such as contributions to scalar masses and fermion electric dipole moments, which were not fully considered in the minimal model (hep-ph/0104276).

The generic supersymmetric standard model is compared to the minimal supersymmetric standard model, differing in the imposition of R-parity. The comparison highlights distinct phenomenological features, including R-parity violating contributions to scalar masses and fermion electric dipole moments (hep-ph/0104276). [Compares]
