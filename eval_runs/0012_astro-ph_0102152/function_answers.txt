The comparison between big bang nucleosynthesis and standard models is made to determine the acceptable range of Omega_b in the presence of antimatter regions. This comparison is based on the abundances of light elements, such as 4He, D/H, and 7Li, which are affected by the presence of antimatter regions during nucleosynthesis (astro-ph/0101236). [Compares]
The comparison between big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background observations informs the understanding of the universe's baryon abundance by providing a basis for evaluating the consistency of theoretical predictions with observational data (astro-ph/0103411). [Background]
