The authors use a previously obtained method to compare the supersymmetry of different deformed D2-brane solutions. They apply this method to examine the supersymmetry of regular deformed D2-brane solutions with fractional D2-branes (hep-th/0101096). [Uses]
The current work compares the supersymmetry of two different deformed D2-brane solutions, one with a transverse space of G_2 holonomy and principal orbits of CP^3 or the flag manifold, and another with principal orbits of S^3 x S^3. The comparison is based on the preservation of supersymmetry, with both solutions preserving 1/16 of the maximal supersymmetry (hep-th/0101096). [Compares]
