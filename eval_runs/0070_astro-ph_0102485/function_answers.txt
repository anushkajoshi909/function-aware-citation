The properties of SNe II-L and SNe IIn extend our understanding of supernovae by revealing interactions with circumstellar material and unusual gas densities. These findings build upon prior knowledge of supernovae types, such as SNe Ib and Ic, by highlighting distinct characteristics like narrow emission lines and slowly declining light curves (astro-ph/0102485).
