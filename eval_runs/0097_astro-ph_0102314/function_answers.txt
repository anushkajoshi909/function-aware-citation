The spectral energy distributions of Cen A and M87 provide insight into their classification as high-energy-peaked BL Lac-like objects by revealing the peaks of their synchrotron emission (astro-ph/0102314). [Background]
The spectral energy distributions of Cen A and M87 extend our knowledge of high-energy-peaked BL Lac-like objects by revealing their synchrotron emission peaks and predicting their Compton emission peaks. This study generalizes the properties of TeV BL Lac objects to HBL-like FRI radio galaxies, increasing our understanding of these objects' properties and behavior (astro-ph/0102314). [Extends]
