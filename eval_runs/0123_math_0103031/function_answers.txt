The current noncommutative probability theories have limitations that can be addressed by further developing the unification of independence achieved through the hierarchy of freeness. This development matters because it can provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding noncommutative independence, potentially resolving gaps in existing theories (math/0103031). [Motivation]
The unification of independence achieved through the hierarchy of freeness can be further developed by extending the approach to more general cases, such as families of sequences of states. Future work may involve exploring the limitations and gaps of current noncommutative probability theories and addressing them through this unified framework (math/0103031). [FutureWork]
