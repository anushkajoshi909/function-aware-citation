The discovery of a gapped spectrum in Piperazinium Hexachlorodicuprate motivates future research into the effects of magnetic fields on quantum disordered phases and the behavior of frustrated quantum magnets. This could lead to a deeper understanding of the interplay between frustration, dimensionality, and magnetic field in quantum systems (cond-mat/0104150). [Motivation]
