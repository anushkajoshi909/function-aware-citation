The authors use heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory to analyze pion-nucleon scattering, allowing for a consistent description of strong and electromagnetic effects. This approach is compared to previous phase shift analyses, revealing sizeable differences in the S-waves of the elastic channels (hep-ph/0101030). [Uses]
The current work uses heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT) and compares its results to previous analyses based on Siegert's theorem, with the HBChPT prediction for the asymmetry being close to the Siegert's theorem based result. The comparison is based on the predicted values of the asymmetry $A_\gamma$ in $\vec{n} + p \to d + \gamma$ at threshold (nucl-th/0101043). [Compares]
