The development of preferred-frame theory is motivated by the idea that gravity can be interpreted as a pressure force and that there is an equivalence between the effects of motion and gravitation (gr-qc/0103025). [Background]
The development of preferred-frame theory is motivated by the need to reconcile special relativity with gravity, as the current understanding of gravity and motion is incomplete. This theory aims to address the gap by providing a new framework that accounts for the effects of gravity on motion (gr-qc/0103025). [Motivation]
