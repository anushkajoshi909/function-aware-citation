The mixed-states and sum-over-states calculations used in this study can be applied to future research on parity nonconserving electric dipole transition amplitudes by utilizing a hybrid approach to achieve high accuracy. This approach can be used to calculate PNC amplitudes in other atoms by measuring specific E1 transition amplitudes to high accuracy (physics/0101044). [Uses]
The methods used in this study can be applied to future research by utilizing a hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach to calculate parity nonconserving electric dipole transition amplitudes with high accuracy, particularly if key transition amplitudes are measured to high accuracy. Future work may focus on measuring these amplitudes to better than 1% accuracy to improve the overall accuracy of the calculations (physics/0101044). [FutureWork]
