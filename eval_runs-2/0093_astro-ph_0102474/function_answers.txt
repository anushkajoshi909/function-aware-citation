The framework of out of equilibrium field dynamics provides background information by investigating the evolution of highly excited quantum states, characterized by a large number of quanta in a band of momenta (astro-ph/0102474). [Background]
The framework of out of equilibrium field dynamics provides crucial background information for understanding the evolution of highly excited quantum states, which is essential for investigating inflation driven by these states. This understanding matters because it can lead to new insights into the initial stages of inflation and the formation of effective homogeneous condensates (astro-ph/0102474). [Motivation]
