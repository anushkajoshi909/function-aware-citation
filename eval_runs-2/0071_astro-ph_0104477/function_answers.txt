The spectroscopic survey of faint lensed galaxies in the core of the galaxy cluster AC114 extends the work of Natarajan et al by confirming predicted lensing redshifts and discovering new multiple-image systems, increasing the scope and accuracy of high-redshift galaxy studies. This extension enables a larger gain in sensitivity towards low-luminosity high-z objects, motivating further research on the faint end of the luminosity function of high-redshift galaxies (astro-ph/0104477).

The spectroscopic survey of faint lensed galaxies in AC114 extends the work of Natarajan et al by confirming predicted lensing redshifts and discovering new multiple-image systems, which motivates further research on the faint end of the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies. This is important because it enables the study of intrinsically fainter galaxies that are beyond the reach of existing blank field studies (astro-ph/0104477). [Motivation]
