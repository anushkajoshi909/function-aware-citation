The current understanding of supernova explosions and their interactions with the circumstellar medium is limited by several challenges, including the lack of observed very young supernova remnants and the difficulty of inferring the nature of the supernova and its progenitor star. These limitations motivate further research to address these gaps in knowledge (astro-ph/0101043). [Motivation]
Further research is needed to overcome the limitations of current spherical models, which fail to produce explosions even with accurate neutrino transport. Future work may involve multi-dimensional hydrodynamics, general relativity, and improved understanding of neutrino interactions in neutron star matter to better comprehend supernova explosions and their interactions with the circumstellar medium (astro-ph/0103015).
