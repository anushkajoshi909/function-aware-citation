The comparison between big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background observations relates to the background understanding of the universe's baryon abundance by probing it at different ages, with the CMB and BBN measurements being compared on the basis of their consistency with the standard model of cosmology. The CMB observations are being compared to BBN results to assess their agreement on the baryon abundance (astro-ph/0102152). [Compares]
