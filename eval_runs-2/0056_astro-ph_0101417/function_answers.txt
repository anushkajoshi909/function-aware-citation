The study of Hercules X-1 in an anomalous low state builds upon previous observations of the system in its short-high state, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of X-ray binary systems by facilitating measurements of period derivatives during low-state activity. This extends our knowledge of these systems by providing a basis for comparison with their behavior during high-state activity (astro-ph/0102100). [Extends]
The study of Hercules X-1 in an anomalous low state provides insight into X-ray binary systems by revealing the behavior of the companion star and the reflection of X-rays (astro-ph/0101417). [Background]
