The current study extends our understanding of the relationship between mass-loss rates and crystalline silicate features in AGB stars by showing that low mass-loss rate objects may also form crystalline silicates, contrary to previous interpretations of ISO observations. This is achieved by accounting for temperature differences between amorphous and crystalline silicates, allowing for up to 40% crystalline silicate material to be present without visible spectral features (astro-ph/0101256).

The current study builds on ISO observations by exploring an alternative explanation for the lack of crystalline silicate features in low mass-loss rate AGB stars (astro-ph/0101256). [Background]
