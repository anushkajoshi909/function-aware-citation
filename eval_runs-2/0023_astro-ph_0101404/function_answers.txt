The limitations of the current study on the Tully-Fisher relation and dark matter halos could motivate future research on galaxy-formation models and the properties of dark matter halos at high redshift. This research could focus on breaking parameter degeneracies and constraining the redshift distribution of collapsing dark-matter halos and star-formation history (astro-ph/0102025). [Motivation]
The study's limitations could motivate future research on constraining the redshift distribution of collapsing dark-matter halos and the star-formation history in disk galaxies. Further investigation could also focus on breaking parameter degeneracies among galactosynthesis models at z=0 using the Tully-Fisher relation at high redshift (astro-ph/0102025). [FutureWork]
