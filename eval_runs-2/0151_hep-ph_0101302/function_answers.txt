The work extends previous lattice estimates by introducing a new approach to expand gauge-invariant Wilson operators, overcoming limitations of former methods. This approach is more versatile, suitable for expanding any Wilson operators on lattice, potentially improving accuracy and scope (hep-lat/0104007). [Extends]
