The mid-infrared spectral energy distribution of Mrk 279 is compared to other Seyfert galaxies in terms of their emission features, with Seyfert 2 objects showing a close relationship between mid-infrared emission and X-ray emission. The comparison is based on the relationship between absorption-corrected soft X-ray emission and mid-infrared emission, which is found to be closely related in Seyfert 2 objects but not in Seyfert 1 objects (astro-ph/0101103).

The mid-infrared spectral energy distribution of Mrk 279 features a strong power law continuum and weak PAH emission, with a mid-IR bump consistent with thermal emission from dust grains (astro-ph/0102356). [Background]
