The current work extends previous research on magnetospheric accretion by applying it to the specific case of RW Aur A, interpreting observed features such as periodic modulations in spectral lines and accretion components. This extension provides a framework for understanding the non-axisymmetric accretion processes in this classical T Tauri star (astro-ph/0102137). [Extends]
The current work uses the framework of non-axisymmetric magnetospheric accretion to interpret the observed features of RW Aur A. Researchers apply this method to understand the periodic modulations in spectral features and the variations in radial velocities and emission line strengths (astro-ph/0102137). [Uses]
