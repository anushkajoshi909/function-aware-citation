The inability to detect the predicted flux of TeV gamma-rays from supernova remnants motivates further research, highlighting limitations in current understanding. These limitations include challenges in injection, maximum achievable particle energy, and spectral index, which suggest a need for more realistic analytical models and numerical techniques (astro-ph/0101175).

The limitations in identifying gamma-ray sources, such as understanding the mechanisms of gamma-ray emission from supernova remnants, motivate further research. Future work may focus on investigating properties like pulsar-driven nebulae and nonthermal X-ray emission to better understand these sources (astro-ph/0104348). [FutureWork]
