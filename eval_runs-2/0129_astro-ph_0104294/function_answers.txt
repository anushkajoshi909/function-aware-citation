The discovery of high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ sources motivates a deeper understanding of chemically primitive galaxies in the early universe because it sheds light on the formation and evolution of galaxy-like objects. This understanding is crucial as it reveals the chemical enrichment history of the universe, particularly the role of supernovae in enriching the gas component of these early galaxies (astro-ph/0104308). [Motivation]
The discovery of high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ sources extends our understanding of chemically primitive galaxies by providing a direct constraint on galaxy formation models, particularly the distribution of infalling cold gas during the early stages of galaxy formation. This extends prior methods by offering a means to detect and characterize the "fuzz" of extended Lyman alpha emission around young quasars (astro-ph/0101174). [Extends]
