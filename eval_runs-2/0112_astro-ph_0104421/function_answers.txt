The study of the 5 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation in GRS 1739-278 extends our understanding of low-frequency QPOs by providing detailed observations of its properties, such as energy dependence and phase lags. This research builds upon prior studies by offering new insights into the behavior of QPOs in black-hole candidates, particularly with regards to their frequency, amplitude, and timing characteristics (astro-ph/0104421).

The study of the 5 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation in GRS 1739-278 is motivated by the need to understand low-frequency QPOs in black-hole candidates, as it provides insights into their properties and behavior. This research is important because it sheds light on the physical mechanisms underlying these oscillations, which can help resolve the existing gaps in our knowledge of black-hole candidates (astro-ph/0104421).
