Future research is motivated by the experimental challenges of measuring muon polarization in kaon decay processes, which could provide insights into new physics and CP violation. The small effects and difficulties in measurement highlight the need for further study, particularly in areas like KMU3 and radiative KMU2 decays (hep-ex/0101003). [Motivation]
Future research directions include detailed examinations of muon polarization in KMU3 and radiative KMU2 decays, as well as measurements of T-violating polarization with high sensitivity to probe new physics. These studies could provide clean measurements of CKM parameters and potentially reveal non-standard CP violation effects (hep-ex/0101003). [FutureWork]
