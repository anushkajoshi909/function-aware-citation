The spectral analysis of the Vela pulsar is compared to standard neutron star cooling models, with the effective temperature found to be lower than predicted. The results are also compared to a standard blackbody fit, which yields an unrealistically small radius, highlighting the differences between the two models (astro-ph/0103171). [Compares]
The spectral analysis of the Vela pulsar extends existing models of neutron star cooling by providing a lower effective temperature than predicted by standard models. The results also refine emission models by resolving the pulsar's spectrum into two distinct components, a softer thermal component and a harder power-law component (astro-ph/0103171). [Extends]
