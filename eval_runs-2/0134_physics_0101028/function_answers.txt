The development of the coupled microwave-cavity system provides background for future improvements in axion detection by demonstrating a tunable cavity resonant frequency and achieving low temperatures to reduce background thermal noise (physics/0101028). [Background]
The development of the coupled microwave-cavity system provides background for future improvements in axion detection by demonstrating the feasibility of a tunable cavity resonant frequency and low-temperature operation, which can be further optimized. Possible future improvements are mentioned, but the specifics are not detailed in the abstract (physics/0101028). [FutureWork]
