The investigation of spatial variation in the cosmological constant is motivated by the possibility of differences in fundamental physical parameters across the universe (hep-ph/0101130). [Background]
The investigation of spatial variation in the cosmological constant is motivated by the possibility that small variations in other physical parameters could produce huge variations in the cosmological constant, making it a sensitive indicator of spatial gradients. This sensitivity provides a powerful indirect test of spatial variation in fundamental physical parameters (hep-ph/0101130). [Motivation]
