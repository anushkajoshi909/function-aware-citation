Future studies can extend the current work's method by applying it to a broader range of galaxy samples and cosmological models, increasing the accuracy of the measured pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion and its implications on galaxy biasing. The method developed by Jing, Mo, & Börner (1998) can be further refined to account for different morphological mixtures of galaxies and to improve the modeling of galaxy biasing in cold dark matter models (astro-ph/0104023).

Future studies can extend the current work by addressing uncertainties in cosmological parameters and galaxy formation processes to better understand galaxy biasing. The field is expected to be led by observational developments that allow model parameters to be tuned and scenarios to be falsified (astro-ph/0103017). [FutureWork]
