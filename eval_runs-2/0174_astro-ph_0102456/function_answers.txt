Previous studies of star formation rates in Lyman break galaxies were limited by uncertainties in calibrations and potential differential extinction between rest-frame optical and UV, leading to potentially inaccurate estimates. The current work aims to address these limitations by directly measuring star formation rates from Hbeta luminosity, finding that they are consistent with those implied by the stellar continuum at 1500 A (astro-ph/0102456). [Motivation]
The current work compares star formation rates deduced from Hbeta luminosity to those implied by the stellar continuum at 1500 A, finding them to be on average no larger, contrary to previous expectations. This comparison is based on observations of 19 Lyman break galaxies using the Keck and VLT telescopes, which suggests that differential extinction between rest-frame optical and UV is small (astro-ph/0102456).
