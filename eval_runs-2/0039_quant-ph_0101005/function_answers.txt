Current understanding of quantum communication and entanglement is limited by the fact that Holevo's theorem restricts the amount of classical information that can be communicated through quantum bits, unless entanglement is involved (quant-ph/0101005). [Background]
The current understanding of quantum communication and entanglement is limited by the fact that Holevo's theorem restricts the amount of classical information that can be communicated through quantum bits, unless entanglement is involved. This limitation motivates further research into the potential of quantum communication and entanglement to enhance classical communication efficiency, particularly in distributed computational tasks where classical simulation is inefficient (quant-ph/0101005).
