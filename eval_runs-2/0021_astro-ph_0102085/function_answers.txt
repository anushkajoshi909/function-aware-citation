The current study's methodology extends previous work by Braun & Burton through the use of deeper HI observations with the 100-m Effelsberg telescope, revealing a more detailed two-phase core/halo structure. The Effelsberg data are compared to Westerbork data from Braun & Burton, showing differences in velocity width and providing new insights into the cloud's structure and interaction with the ambient medium (astro-ph/0103119).

The current study extends previous work by Braun & Burton by providing deeper HI observations of the compact high-velocity cloud HVC125+41-207, revealing a more detailed two-phase core/halo structure. The new observations increase the accuracy of the cloud's velocity width and column density distribution, and allow for a more detailed analysis of the cloud's interaction with the ambient medium (astro-ph/0103119).
