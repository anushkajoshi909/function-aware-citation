The Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics uses the Heisenberg picture to provide a local explanation for correlations between spatially-separated quantum systems by transforming operators that "label" multiple local copies of systems and observers (quant-ph/0103079). [Background]
The Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics uses the Heisenberg picture to provide a local explanation for correlations between spatially-separated quantum systems by transforming Heisenberg-picture operators that label copies of systems and observers. This approach allows for many local copies of experimental systems and observers, resolving nonlocality issues through proliferating labels (quant-ph/0103079). [Uses]
