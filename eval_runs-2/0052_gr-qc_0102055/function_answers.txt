The identification of Hilbert's error motivates a deeper understanding of black holes because it reveals that his mistake led to an analytically extendible space-time containing a black hole. This error correction extends the understanding of black holes in the context of Schwarzschild's result by showing that the Kruskal-Fronsdal black hole is an artifact of Hilbert's mistake (gr-qc/0102055). [Motivation]
The identification of Hilbert's error extends Schwarzschild's result by revealing that the space-time is analytically extendible, containing a black hole, whereas Hilbert's incorrect assertion led to a different boundary. This extension improves the understanding of black holes by showing that the Kruskal-Fronsdal black hole is a consequence of Hilbert's mistake (gr-qc/0102055). [Extends]
