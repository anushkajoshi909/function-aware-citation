The proposed unification model based on a semi-simple group is compared to conventional supersymmetric grand unified theories in terms of solving the problems of large mass splitting and proton lifetime, with the semi-simple group model offering a solution to both issues simultaneously. The comparison is based on the models' ability to address these problems, with the semi-simple group model providing a more comprehensive solution (hep-ph/0103251). [Compares]
The proposed unification model based on a semi-simple group addresses the problems of large mass splitting and proton lifetime in conventional supersymmetric grand unified theories, providing a more consistent solution. This model is motivated by the need to solve these two serious problems that plague traditional theories (hep-ph/0103251). [Motivation]
