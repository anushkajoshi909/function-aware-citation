The current work's understanding of electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves compares to previous thoughts in that it reveals a more complex structure, including both density enhancements and depletions, whereas previous work considered only density depletions. This reexamination was motivated by the limitation of previous work in understanding the physical roles of trapped and passing electrons in these solitary waves (physics/0103020). [Compares]
Previous work on electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves was limited by the assumption that they consisted only of a density depletion, and that thermal screening by the ambient plasma was necessary. This reexamination was motivated by the need to resolve these limitations and provide a more accurate understanding of the physical roles of trapped and passing electrons in these waves (physics/0103020).
