The current work compares the relationship between ACM and glicci schemes to previous studies, which had only established the equivalence in codimension two, by investigating the converse implication in higher codimension. The investigation is motivated by the fact that the converse is an important open question, and the authors' results show that any Hilbert function among ACM schemes also occurs among glicci schemes, unlike when restricted to complete intersection links (math/0103188).

The current work investigates the relationship between ACM and glicci schemes because the converse of the implication that glicci schemes are ACM is an important open question in higher codimension. This investigation is motivated by the fact that the equivalence between ACM and licci schemes in codimension two does not hold in higher codimension (math/0103188). [Motivation]
