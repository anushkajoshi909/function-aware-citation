Supersymmetric extensions of the standard model, such as the CMSSM, build upon our current understanding of CP violation by introducing new sources of CP violation beyond the single source in the standard model. These extensions increase the scope of CP violation, allowing for potential departures from the standard model in rare phenomena, particularly in B physics (hep-ph/0104027). [Extends]
Recent experimental results on CP violation, such as $a_{\psi K_S}$, motivate the study of extensions to the Standard Model, as they may reveal new physics beyond the electroweak standard model. These extensions, including supersymmetric models, aim to build upon our current understanding of CP violation and its role in new physics (hep-ph/0103299). [Motivation]
