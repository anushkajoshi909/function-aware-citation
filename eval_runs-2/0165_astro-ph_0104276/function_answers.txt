The current understanding of Population III star formation can be extended through numerical simulations that investigate the collapse and fragmentation of primordial gas. These simulations raise new questions and provide a foundation for future research to better constrain the initial mass function of these stars (astro-ph/0103382). [Extends]
Further research is needed to better understand Population III star formation, particularly through numerical simulations that can inform the initial mass function of these stars. The abstract suggests that new questions have been raised, implying a need for continued investigation to address them (astro-ph/0103382). [FutureWork]
