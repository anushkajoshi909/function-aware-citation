The calculation of multi-loop master integrals was hindered by difficulties, prompting the development of a new method based on numerical solutions of systems of difference equations (hep-ph/0102033). [Background]
The calculation of multi-loop master integrals is hindered by limitations in current methods, motivating the development of a new approach based on numerical solutions of difference equations. Understanding this new method requires background knowledge of integration-by-parts identities, factorial series, and Laplace's transformation (hep-ph/0102033). [Motivation]
