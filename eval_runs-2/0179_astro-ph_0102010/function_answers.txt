The current work extends previous research on baryon fraction in clusters by re-examining the gas fraction profile and its implications for the cosmological density parameter, suggesting that previous estimates of a low-density universe may be inaccurate. It builds upon prior analyses by incorporating recent estimates of gas content and correction factors, leading to a revised understanding of the baryon fraction that allows for higher values of the cosmological density parameter (astro-ph/0102010).

The current work uses previous research on baryon fraction in clusters, such as Vikhlinin et al. (1999), to inform the estimation of the cosmological density parameter $\Omega_0$. [Uses]
