Future experiments can extend the current analysis by exploring the three new-physics observables introduced, which may become accessible at second-generation B experiments, and by investigating large rescattering effects that could make all three observables sizeable. The current model-independent parametrization can be extended in scope by imposing a dynamical hierarchy of amplitudes and considering new-physics effects at the decay-amplitude level (hep-ph/0101276).

Future experiments can extend the current analysis by measuring the remaining two new-physics observables, which will likely be accessible at second-generation B experiments. Additionally, further study is needed to understand the impact of large rescattering effects on these observables (hep-ph/0101276). [FutureWork]
