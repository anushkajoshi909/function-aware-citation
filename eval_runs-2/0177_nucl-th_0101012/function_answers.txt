The local energy-density functional method extends existing nuclear physics calculations, such as the conventional mean field Skyrme-HFB and relativistic Hartree-BCS calculations, to investigate differential observables like odd-even mass differences and charge radii with improved treatment of pairing interactions. It builds upon these methods by incorporating a zero-range cutoff density-dependent pairing interaction with a density-gradient term, allowing for a more accurate description of nuclear ground-state properties (nucl-th/0101012).

The local energy-density functional method uses the Gor'kov equations and a zero-range cutoff density-dependent pairing interaction to investigate differential observables. It extends existing nuclear physics calculations by comparing its results with conventional mean field Skyrme-HFB and relativistic Hartree-BCS calculations (nucl-th/0101012). [Uses]
