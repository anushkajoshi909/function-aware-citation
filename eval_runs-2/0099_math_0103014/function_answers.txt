The analysis of the cyclic group of units in Z_k is extended to explore new areas of residue arithmetic by generalizing Fermat's Small Theorem to mod p^k and examining the properties of p-th power residues. This extension improves the understanding of residue arithmetic by allowing the analysis of divisors of 0 mod p^k and showing that each residue mod p^k can be represented as the sum of at most four p-th power residues (math/0103083).

The analysis of the cyclic group of units in Z_k can be extended by exploring the additive properties of its lattice and the Boolean lattice formed by idempotents. Future research directions may involve induction on k and extending residues mod m_k to yield a prime sieve for integers and further investigate the relationship between Goldbach's Conjecture and "Goldbach for Residues" (math/0103091).
