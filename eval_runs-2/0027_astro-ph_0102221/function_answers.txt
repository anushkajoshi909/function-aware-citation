The heating of X-Ray hot gas in galaxy groups is thought to result from either a universal external heating process, such as AGN or population III stars, or internal heating by Type II supernovae (astro-ph/0101517). [Background]
Future work on the heating of X-Ray hot gas in galaxy groups can build on the finding that internal heating by Type II supernovae is a preferred mechanism, and investigate the implications of different initial mass functions on the energy required to heat the gas. The open problem of how supernova energy is transferred to the hot gas remains to be addressed (astro-ph/0101517). [FutureWork]
