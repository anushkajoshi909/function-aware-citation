The discovery of the 29 keV Cyclotron Resonant Scattering Feature in 4U 0352+309 extends previous research on X-ray pulsars by applying established spectral analysis methods to a low-luminosity pulsar. This work improves upon prior spectral fits by incorporating a CRSF, increasing the accuracy of the model for this specific type of X-ray pulsar (astro-ph/0101110). [Extends]
Researchers use the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer to discover a Cyclotron Resonant Scattering Feature in the X-Ray spectrum of 4U 0352+309. They apply established spectral analysis methods, including continuum models and phase-resolved analysis, to fit the observations and determine the properties of the feature (astro-ph/0101110).
