The current work uses a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) to investigate the microstructure of the MgB2 superconductor. This method aims to solve the problem of understanding the microstructure of highly dense MgB2, specifically to verify if it can be sintered to its theoretical density without porosity or grain growth (cond-mat/0102498). [Uses]
The work uses single and multi-band Eliashberg models to investigate the microstructure of the MgB2 superconductor. It aims to solve the problem of understanding the relatively high upper critical field in MgB2 by analyzing the involvement of heavy quasiparticles and their coupling to bosons (cond-mat/0103154).
