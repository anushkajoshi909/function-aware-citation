VLBI's ability to image large fields-of-view with sub-mJy detection limits allows for the distinction between starburst and AGN activity in distant sources (astro-ph/0102037). [Background]
The capability of VLBI to image large fields-of-view with sub-mJy detection limits is crucial for distinguishing between starburst and AGN activity in distant sources, which is essential for understanding their nature. This capability enables the study of faint radio sources, such as those in the Hubble Deep Field, and sheds light on the coexistence of AGN and starburst activity in these sources (astro-ph/0102037).
