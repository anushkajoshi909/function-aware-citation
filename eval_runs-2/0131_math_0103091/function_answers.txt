The background information on prime numbers motivating the current work on Goldbach's Conjecture includes the fact that there are infinitely many primes and that all primes between the kth prime and the product of the first k primes have certain properties mod the product of the first k primes (math/0103091) (math/0103091). [Background]
The current work on Goldbach's Conjecture is motivated by the lack of a proof for the conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 4 can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes. This problem matters because a failure to prove Goldbach's Conjecture would contradict the proven "Goldbach for Residues" mod m_k (math/0103091). [Motivation]
