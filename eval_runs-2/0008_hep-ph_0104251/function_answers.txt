The thesis extends the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model by considering a generic version without imposed R-parity, allowing for new phenomenological features. This extension enables the exploration of R-parity violating contributions, which had been largely overlooked, and their implications for various phenomena (hep-ph/0104276). [Extends]
The generic supersymmetric standard model is compared to the minimal supersymmetric standard model, differing in the imposition of R-parity. The comparison highlights distinct phenomenological features, including R-parity violating contributions to scalar masses and fermion electric dipole moments (hep-ph/0104276). [Compares]
