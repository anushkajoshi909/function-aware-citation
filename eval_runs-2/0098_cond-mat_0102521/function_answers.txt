The coarsening behaviors of CD models on Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) surfaces are compared to those on the Golubovic-Bruinsma-Das Sarma-Tamborenea (GBDT) surface, with analysis based on the distribution of particle cluster sizes and the scaled 2-point spatial correlation function. The comparison is made using analytic and numerical methods, which reveal differences in the power-law decay of cluster size distributions and the exponent values of the correlation functions (cond-mat/0102521).

The authors use analytic and numerical methods to analyze the coarsening behaviors of CD models on different surfaces, including Edwards-Wilkinson and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang surfaces. They apply the independent interval approximation to derive a relationship between the exponents describing the distribution of particle cluster sizes and the spatial correlation function (cond-mat/0102521).
