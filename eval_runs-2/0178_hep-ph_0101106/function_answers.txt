The current work on CP-violating phases can be extended by exploring the measurement of these phases at a future linear collider, building on prior methods by increasing the precision of phase determination and considering CP-odd kinematical variables. This extension improves the accuracy of phase measurement, such as determining $\phi_1$ to a precision of $\pi/30$, and efficiency in identifying CP violation, albeit with challenges due to small CP asymmetries (hep-ph/0101106).

The current work on CP-violating phases can be extended by exploring the measurement of these phases at a future linear collider, where the determination of certain phases and model parameters can be achieved with high precision. Further research directions include constructing CP-odd kinematical variables to unambiguously identify CP violation, despite the challenge of small CP asymmetries (hep-ph/0101106). [FutureWork]
