The current work's method of deriving the color-magnitude relation is compared to previous methods that use fixed apertures, and it uses a sample of 48 giant early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster with CCD observations to achieve this comparison. The new method, based on color measurements within the galaxy's effective radius, is found to produce a significantly flatter relation than those based on fixed-aperture measurements (astro-ph/0102090).

The current work uses a sample of 48 giant early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster with CCD observations in the U- and V-band to derive the color-magnitude relation. It applies color measurements within an aperture of radius equal to the galaxy effective radius to achieve a comparison with previous methods that used fixed apertures (astro-ph/0102090). [Uses]
