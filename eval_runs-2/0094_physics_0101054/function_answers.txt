The current work extends Einstein's introduction of coefficients of spontaneous and induced emission by rederiving Planck's blackbody radiation law within the framework of stochastic electrodynamics, avoiding the assumption of quantum energy discreteness. This approach builds upon Einstein's work by providing a classical physics explanation for the energy discreteness, utilizing the concept of de Broglie waves and zero-point vibrations of the electromagnetic ground field (physics/0101054).

The current work utilizes Einstein's introduction of coefficients of spontaneous and induced emission to derive Planck's blackbody radiation law within the framework of stochastic electrodynamics. This approach reconsiders Einstein's work from the viewpoint of classical electrodynamics with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation (physics/0101054). [Uses]
