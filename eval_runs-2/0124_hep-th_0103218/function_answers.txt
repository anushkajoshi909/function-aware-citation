The concept of discrete scalar fields is compared to MOND, with the introduction of an effective-acceleration scale potentially putting MOND on a more solid physical basis. Discrete scalar fields also utilize Tsallis statistics, which is regarded as proper for discrete-interaction systems, differing from Boltzmann statistics in its application to non-idealized states (hep-th/0103218).

The concept of discrete scalar fields utilizes existing theories such as MOND and Tsallis statistics to provide a more solid physical basis and describe discrete-interaction systems. Researchers use MOND and Tsallis statistics to understand the implications of discrete scalar fields, particularly in relation to gravitational interactions and non-idealized systems (hep-th/0103218).
