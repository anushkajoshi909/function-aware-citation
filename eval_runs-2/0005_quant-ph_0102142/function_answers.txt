The pseudo mode theory extends previous work by applying the Fano diagonalisation method to systems with structured reservoirs, enabling the treatment of non-Markovian behavior in atomic systems with improved accuracy. This approach builds upon prior methods by allowing for the treatment of multiple excitation cases via Markovian master equations, providing a more efficient and structured framework for analyzing atomic systems coupled to quantum EM field modes (quant-ph/0102142).

The pseudo mode theory extends previous work by treating non-Markovian behavior in atomic systems through a quasimode theory that structures the reservoir of true modes. This approach is compared to Markovian master equations, with the pseudo mode theory enabling treatment of multiple excitation cases via these equations for the atom-discrete quasimode system (quant-ph/0102142).
