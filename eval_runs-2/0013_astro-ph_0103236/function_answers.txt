The development of the BMW catalogue motivates existing work in X-ray source detection by addressing the need for improved detection of low surface-brightness sources, such as distant clusters. This is important because it enables the identification of rare, highly-luminous systems at higher redshifts, which can provide valuable insights into the universe's structure and evolution (astro-ph/0101437). [Motivation]
The development of the BMW catalogue extends existing work in X-ray source detection by improving the detection of extended sources and point sources in crowded fields, leveraging the Wavelet Transform algorithm. This approach enhances the accuracy of source extension and position determination, particularly with the high angular resolution of HRI images (astro-ph/0103236). [Extends]
