The study of a two giant planet system's coupled evolution is motivated by the need to understand how the migration of planets is affected by the presence of multiple planets, which can lead to different outcomes compared to the one planet case. This is important because the traditional understanding of planet migration, based on single planet systems, may not apply to multi-planet systems (astro-ph/0101332). [Motivation]
The study of a two giant planet system is motivated by its comparison to the one planet case in terms of migration, with the two planet system exhibiting outwards migration due to resonance trapping. The two planet system is compared to the one planet case on the basis of angular momentum exchange with the disk and the resulting differential Lindblad torque (astro-ph/0101332). [Compares]
