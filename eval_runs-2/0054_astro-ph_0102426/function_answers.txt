Future research on UHE neutrino scattering onto relic cosmic neutrinos may be motivated by its potential to overcome the GZK cut-off and reveal new information about neutrino masses and relic densities. This is significant because it could provide insights into neutrino properties, such as degenerate masses or mass splits, which could be reflected in UHECR flux modulations beyond GZK energies (astro-ph/0102426).
