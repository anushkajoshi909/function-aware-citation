The mass function of open clusters is not well understood, particularly at lower masses, due to limitations such as strong background irregularities, dynamical evolution, and interaction with the Galactic field (astro-ph/0101371). [Background]
The current understanding of the mass function of open clusters is limited by uncertainties and biases, particularly at lower masses, due to factors such as strong background irregularities, dynamical evolution, and unresolved binaries. This limitation motivates further study to accurately determine the mass function and initial mass function of open clusters (astro-ph/0101371). [Motivation]
