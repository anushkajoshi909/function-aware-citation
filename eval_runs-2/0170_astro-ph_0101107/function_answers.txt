The current study's finding on the lower mass threshold for Hot Bottom Burning is compared to existing stellar evolution models, which previously claimed that thermal pulses do not occur in zero metal intermediate mass stars. The study's results, showing that models with mass larger than 6 Mo experience "normal" AGB evolution, differ from previous claims and may inform future research to resolve the discrepancy between observed and predicted luminosity of carbon stars (astro-ph/0103104).
