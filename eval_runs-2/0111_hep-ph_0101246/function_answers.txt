The limitations of current photon emission calculations in high-energy collisions, such as those in photon-photon processes, motivate future research in precision measurements. This research is necessary to improve the accuracy of calculations, particularly in the low and high energy regions, which could be achieved with future Linear Colliders (hep-ph/0104015). [Motivation]
Future research could be motivated by the limitations of current photon emission calculations, potentially focusing on QCD studies in two-photon interactions. The development of future linear colliders may also provide new avenues for investigation (hep-ph/0101075). [FutureWork]
