The detection of upper main sequence stars and red giant branch stars in the halo of an amorphous galaxy relates to previous work on galaxy interactions, as it may be associated with star formation triggered by tidal interactions (astro-ph/0103121). [Background]
The detection of upper main sequence stars and red giant branch stars in the halo of NGC 3077 is compared to previous work on galaxy interactions, suggesting that the observed stars are likely the result of star formation triggered by the tidal interaction with M81. The distance measurement of NGC 3077 is also compared to estimates of other galaxies in the M81 Group, showing good agreement (astro-ph/0103121). [Compares]
