The current X-ray spectral analysis of Seyfert 2 galaxies extends previous work by deriving their basic spectral properties and comparing them to Seyfert 1 galaxies, revealing similar photon indices to narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. This extension motivates further investigation into the nature of Seyfert 2 galaxies, particularly their potential for strong star formation and X-ray variability (astro-ph/0101184). [Extends]
The current X-ray spectral analysis of Seyfert 2 galaxies extends previous work by revealing similarities with narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and suggesting strong star formation, motivating further investigation into the nature of these galaxies. This work is important because it highlights differences in X-ray properties between Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies, particularly in relation to interaction strength and star formation (astro-ph/0101184).
