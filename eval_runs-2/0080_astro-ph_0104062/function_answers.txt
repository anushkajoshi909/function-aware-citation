Researchers use the analysis of the absorption feature in GRB 990705 to inform the study of supernova remnants and their impact on afterglow generation. The methods applied to this absorption feature, such as investigating production mechanisms and modeling the absorbing material, can be used to understand the properties of supernova remnants (astro-ph/0104062).

The methods used to analyze the absorption feature in GRB 990705 could inform future research on supernova remnants by exploring how they impact afterglow generation, particularly in scenarios where the remnant surrounds the burst site. Further study is needed to understand the physical conditions and geometry of the absorbing material in relation to afterglow production (astro-ph/0104062). [FutureWork]
