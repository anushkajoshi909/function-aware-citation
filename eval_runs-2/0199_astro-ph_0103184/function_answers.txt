The discovery of non-thermal emission in dust-enshrouded Wolf-Rayet stars extends our understanding of dust production by suggesting that wind compression in binary systems is necessary for efficient dust production, thus motivating a re-evaluation of single-star and binary stellar evolution models. This finding broadens the scope of these models by implying that most dusty WC8-10 stars must be in binaries (astro-ph/0103184). [Extends]
The discovery of non-thermal emission in dust-enshrouded Wolf-Rayet stars motivates a re-evaluation of stellar evolution models because it suggests that binary systems are necessary for efficient dust production. This challenges current single-star and binary stellar evolution models, which will need to be revised if the hypothesis that most dusty WC8-10 stars are in binaries is confirmed (astro-ph/0103184).
