Understanding how X-ray photons interact with pixels, including charge spillover to adjacent pixels, provides background for determining the X-ray landing position (physics/0101052). [Background]
The Chandra ACIS uses split pixel events to improve spatial resolution by selecting X-ray events that deposit charge in more than one pixel, allowing for subpixel resolution. This method is applied to X-ray images of point-like sources to achieve better position accuracy than the CCD pixel size (astro-ph/0101557). [Uses]
