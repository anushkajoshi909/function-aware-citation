The new self-interaction correction method builds upon existing density functional theory methods, such as the local density approximation (LDA) and the older self-interaction correction (SIC) method, by providing a more accurate correction that is totally free from self interaction. This new method extends the scope and accuracy of prior methods, including the older SIC method, by correctly capturing the asymptotic 1/r dependence and yielding improved results for total energy and cohesive energy (cond-mat/0103324).

The new self-interaction correction method builds upon existing density functional theory methods, specifically the local-density approximation. Researchers use self-interaction correction within this framework to describe the ground state of simple metal clusters (physics/0103032). [Uses]
