The current work builds upon existing noncommutative open string theories, comparing and utilizing them to study dualities such as S and T-dualities. It also relates to noncommutative Yang-Mills theories in the context of D-branes in a background electric B-field (hep-th/0101045). [Compares]
The current work utilizes noncommutative open string theories to describe the low energy theory of D-branes in a background electric B-field. It also explores the dualities of these theories, including S and T-dualities, and their relation to a U-duality group (hep-th/0101045). [Uses]
