Future research could investigate ways to differentiate between vertical and horizontal line nodes in spin-triplet superconducting states, as the current study's inability to do so leaves uncertainty about the pairing models in materials like Sr_2RuO_4. This distinction is crucial for understanding the underlying superconducting mechanisms in these materials (cond-mat/0104432). [Motivation]
