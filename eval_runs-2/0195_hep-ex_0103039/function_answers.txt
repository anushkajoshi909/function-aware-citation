The current work compares to previous research by analyzing fermion-pair and photon-pair production in e+e- collisions on the full LEP2 data set, extending previous studies by presenting preliminary results and deriving lower limits for new physics phenomena. The comparison is based on the experimental measurements and results from the LEP-wide combination, which constrain the scales of contact interactions and low gravity effective Planck scale to higher values than previously determined (hep-ex/0103039).

The current work extends previous research on fermion-pair and photon-pair production in e+e- collisions by analyzing the full LEP2 data set, increasing the accuracy and scope of the measurements. It also improves upon prior results by setting more stringent lower limits on the scales of new physics phenomena, such as contact interactions and low gravity effective Planck scale (hep-ex/0103039).
