The experimental studies of discrete breathers in superconducting arrays, such as Josephson-junction ladder arrays, provide a foundation for future research by demonstrating the detection and control of breather states under various array parameters (cond-mat/0102203). [Background]
The study of discrete breathers provides a foundation for future research in areas such as understanding slow relaxation properties of glassy materials and energy focusing in biomolecules. Future directions may include exploring targeted charge transfer of nonlinear electrons and transfer of other excitations, such as Davydov solitons (cond-mat/0102162). [FutureWork]
