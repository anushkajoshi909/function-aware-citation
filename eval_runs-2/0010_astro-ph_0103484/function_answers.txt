The methods used in this study, which involve analyzing X-ray luminosity from OB star populations and associated sources, can inform future research on the X-ray luminosity of starburst galaxies by helping to quantify the contribution of star formation to their total X-ray emission. Researchers can apply these methods to assess the fraction of X-ray emission from starburst galaxies that arises from their OB star populations (astro-ph/0103484). [Uses]
The methods used in this study can inform future research on the X-ray luminosity of starburst galaxies by investigating the nature of the additional emission component required to explain the observed hard X-ray emission in some systems. Future work may focus on determining the implications of this additional emission for the contribution of starbursts to the cosmic X-ray background (astro-ph/0103484). [FutureWork]
