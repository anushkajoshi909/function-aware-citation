Geometrical stability theory provides a foundation for studying homogeneous models by characterizing definable groups in models of a simple first-order theory (math/0101036). [Background]
The concept of geometrical stability theory is extended to non-saturated structures, specifically homogeneous models, by generalizing the theory to accommodate noncompact Stone topologies. This extension builds upon prior results on saturated models, broadening the scope of geometrical stability theory to include strongly lambda-homogeneous models with symmetric and transitive notions of independence (math/0101036).
