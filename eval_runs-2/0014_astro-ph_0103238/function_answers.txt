The properties of host galaxies of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, including their masses and structural parameters, provide a foundation for understanding the origin of radio loudness (astro-ph/0103238). [Background]
The properties of host galaxies of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars suggest that future research should investigate the relationship between black hole mass, accretion efficiency, and radio loudness. Further studies on the role of host galaxy properties in determining radio loudness are needed to resolve the long-standing problem of its origin (astro-ph/0103238). [FutureWork]
