The study of NGC 3065 is motivated by its X-ray properties, and understanding its classification as a LINER with broad, variable Balmer lines requires background knowledge of active galactic nuclei and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (astro-ph/0101050). [Background]
The study of NGC 3065 is motivated by its unique X-ray properties, which led to the discovery of its LINER classification and broad, variable Balmer lines. Understanding its classification as a LINER with these characteristics requires background knowledge of active galactic nuclei and the properties of LINERs with broad, variable Balmer lines (astro-ph/0101050).
