The re-examination of global axisymmetric stability is motivated by the potential occurrence of magnetorotational instabilities in flows that are hydrodynamically stable according to Rayleigh's criterion (astro-ph/0104206). [Background]
The re-examination of global axisymmetric stability is motivated by the need to understand magnetorotational instabilities in flows that are hydrodynamically stable, which is crucial for astrophysical applications. Background information on Rayleigh's criterion and previous work on Rayleigh-unstable regimes is necessary to understand this re-examination (astro-ph/0104206). [Motivation]
