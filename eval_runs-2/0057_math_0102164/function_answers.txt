This work extends previous research on quantum field theories by generalizing the particle interpretation to arbitrarily moving observers in electromagnetic backgrounds, addressing limitations in earlier studies that relied on specific coordinate or gauge choices. The approach builds upon Gibbons' method and conventional multiparticle quantum mechanics to provide a more straightforward and coordinate-independent definition of particles (hep-th/0103228).

The current work extends previous research on quantum field theories by addressing limitations in earlier studies that relied on specific choices of coordinates, gauge, or particle detectors. This extension was motivated by the need for a more general and observer-independent definition of particles in electromagnetic backgrounds (hep-th/0103228). [Motivation]
