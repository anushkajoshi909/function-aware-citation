The properties of SNe II-L and SNe IIn extend our understanding of supernovae by revealing interactions with circumstellar material and unusual gas densities. These findings build upon prior knowledge of supernovae types, such as SNe Ib and Ic, by highlighting distinct characteristics like narrow emission lines and variable light curves (astro-ph/0102485).

The radio properties of SN 1961V are compared to those of Type II radio supernovae on the basis of spectral index and power-law decay. The comparison extends understanding of supernovae by highlighting similarities and differences between SN 1961V and other types, such as luminous blue variables (astro-ph/0104235). [Compares]
