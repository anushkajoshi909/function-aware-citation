The analysis of the X-ray source is motivated by the need to understand the properties of black holes in stellar binary systems, particularly their mass and spin. Investigating these properties matters because it can provide insights into the physics of accretion flows and the formation of relativistic jets (astro-ph/0103431). [Motivation]
The authors use multiresolution filtering and SExtractor to analyze X-ray sources, and also apply the maximum likelihood technique for point-like sources. These methods are used to detect and understand the properties of X-ray sources, including unresolved and extended sources, in XMM-Newton images (astro-ph/0102297). [Uses]
