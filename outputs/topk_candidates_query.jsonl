For\nthe foreseeable future, therefore, this field will be led by observational\ndevelopments allowing model parameters to be tuned and, hopefully, particular\nscenarios falsified. In these lectures I focus on two ingredients in this class\nof models: (i) the role of galaxy bias in interpreting clustering data; and\n(ii) the statistical properties of the initial fluctuations. In the later case,\nI discuss some ideas as to how the standard assumption - that the primordial\ndensity fluctuations constitute a Gaussian random field - can be tested using\nmeasurements galaxy clustering and the cosmic microwave background.", "score": 0.12740090489387512, "cosine": 0.8547046780586243, "title_matches": "", "abs_matches": "bias, galaxies", "query_terms_used": "bias, introduced, fixed, apertures, determining, color, magnitude, relation, early, type, galaxies, motivate, extend, previous, studies, topic", "classifier_functions": "Motivation, Extends", "retrieval_error": null, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-15T14:25:10.823959"}

Soucail", "abstract": "We investigate the potentiality of using strong lensing clusters to constrain\nthe cosmological parameters Omega_m and Omega_lambda. The existence of a\nmultiple image system with known redshift allows, for a given (Omega_m,\nOmega_lambda) cosmology, absolute calibration of the total mass deduced from\nlens modelling. Recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of galaxy\nclusters reveal a large number of multiple images, which are predicted to be at\ndifferent redshifts. If it is possible to measure spectroscopically the\nredshifts of many multiple images then one can in principle constrain\n(Omega_m,Omega_lambda) through ratios of angular diameter distances,\nindependently of any external assumptions. For a regular/relaxed cluster\nobserved by HST with 3 multiple image systems, each with different\nspectroscopic redshifts, we show by analytic calculation that the following\nuncertainties can be expected: Omega_m=0.30 +/- 0.11, Omega_lambda=0.70 +/-\n0.23 or Omega_m=1.00 +/- 0.17, Omega_lambda=0.00 +/- 0.48 for the two most\npopular world models. Numerical tests on simulated data confirm these good\nconstraints, even in the case of more realistic cluster potentials, such as\nbimodal clusters, or when including perturbations by galaxies. To investigate\nthe sensitivity of the method to different mass profiles, we also use an\nanalytic ``pseudo-elliptical'' Navarro, Frenk & White profile in the\nsimulations. These constraints can be improved if more than 3 multiple images\nwith spectroscopic redshifts are observed, or by combining the results from\ndifferent clusters.

Preston", "abstract": "We have performed a multi-dimensional correlation analysis on the observed\nproperties of a statistically complete core-selected sample of compact\nradio-loud active galactic nuclei, based on data from the VLBI Space Observing\nProgramme (Paper I) and previously published studies. Our sample is drawn from\nthe well-studied Pearson-Readhead (PR) survey, and is ideally suited for\ninvestigating the general effects of relativistic beaming in compact radio\nsources. In addition to confirming many previously known correlations, we have\ndiscovered several new trends that lend additional support to the beaming\nmodel. These trends suggest that the most highly beamed sources in\ncore-selected samples tend to have a) high optical polarizations; b) large\npc/kpc-scale jet misalignments; c) prominent VLBI core components; d)\none-sided, core, or halo radio morphology on kiloparsec scales; e) narrow\nemission line equivalent widths; and f) a strong tendency for intraday\nvariability at radio wavelengths. We have used higher resolution space and\nground-based VLBI maps to confirm the bi-modality of the jet misalignment\ndistribution for the PR survey, and find that the sources with aligned parsec-\nand kiloparsec-scale jets generally have arcsecond-scale radio emission on both\nsides of the core. The aligned sources also have broader emission line widths.\nWe find evidence that the BL Lacertae objects in the PR survey are all highly\nbeamed, and have very similar properties to the high-optically polarized\nquasars, with the exception of smaller redshifts.
