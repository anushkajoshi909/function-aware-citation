Specifically, we assess the effect of\nthe summation rules on accuracy; we determine the rate of convergence of the\nmethod in the presence of strong singularities, such as point loads; and we\nassess the effect of the refinement tolerance, which controls the rate at which\nnew nodes are inserted in the model, on the development of dislocation\nmicrostructures.", "score": 0.11068375408649445, "cosine": 0.8500218391418457, "title_matches": "", "abs_matches": "", "query_terms_used": "hybrid, mixed, states, sum, states, compare, previous, extend, calculation, pnc, amplitudes", "classifier_functions": "Compares, Extends", "retrieval_error": null, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-09T18:03:58.180609"}
