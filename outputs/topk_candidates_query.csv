  galaxies",2001,Marco Scodeggio,"The traditional use of fixed apertures in determining the well known
color-magnitude (CM) relation of early type galaxies, coupled with the presence
of radial color gradients within these systems, introduces a bias in the CM
relation itself. The effect of this bias is studied here deriving a CM relation
which is based on color measurements carried out homogeneously within an
aperture of radius equal to that of the galaxy effective radius. A sample of 48
giant early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster, with CCD observations in the U-
and V-band, is used for this derivation. It is found that internal radial color
gradients in early-type galaxies cannot be neglected when discussing the colors
of these systems, and that the CM relation derived using color measurements
within the effective radius is significantly flatter than those based on
fixed-aperture color measurements. With the presently available data it is
impossible to determine whether the relation is completely flat, or whether a
small correlation is still present between galaxy color and luminosity.",1.0,0.8978575468063354,"color, early, galaxies, magnitude, relation, type","apertures, bias, color, determining, early, fixed, galaxies, magnitude, relation, type","bias, introduced, fixed, apertures, determining, color, magnitude, relation, early, type, galaxies, motivate, extend, previous, studies, topic","Motivation, Extends",,2025-09-15T14:25:10.823959

galaxies in the Virgo cluster using spectra of very high S/N ratio for six
elliptical galaxies selected along the CMR. The data are analysed using a new
evolutionary stellar population synthesis model to generate galaxy spectra at
the resolution given by their velocity dispersions. In particular we use a new
age indicator that is virtually free of the effects of metallicity. We find
that the luminosity weighted mean ages of Virgo ellipticals are greater than ~8
Gyr, and show no clear trend with galaxy luminosity. We also find a positive
correlation of metallicity with luminosity, colour and velocity dispersion. We
conclude that the CMR is driven primarily by a luminosity-metallicity
correlation. However, not all elements increase equally with the total
metallicity and we speculate that the CMR may be driven by both a total
metallicity increase and by a systematic departure from solar abundance ratios
of some elements along the CMR. A full understanding of the role played by the
total metallicity, abundance ratios and age in generating the CMR requires the
analysis of spectra of very high quality, such as those reported here, for a
larger number of galaxies in Virgo and other clusters.",0.4066191017627716,0.8685129284858704,"magnitude, relation","early, galaxies, magnitude, relation, type","bias, introduced, fixed, apertures, determining, color, magnitude, relation, early, type, galaxies, motivate, extend, previous, studies, topic","Motivation, Extends",,2025-09-15T14:25:10.823959
2,astro-ph/0102393,On the estimation of galaxy structural parameters: the Sersic Model,2001,Ignacio TrujilloAlister W. GrahamNicola Caon,"This paper addresses some questions which have arisen from the use of the
S\'ersic r^{1/n} law in modelling the luminosity profiles of early type
galaxies. The first issue deals with the trend between the half-light radius
and the structural parameter n. We show that the correlation between these two
parameters is not only real, but is a natural consequence from the previous
relations found to exist between the model-independent parameters: total
luminosity, effective radius and effective surface brightness. We also define a
new galaxy concentration index which is largely independent of the image
exposure depth, and monotonically related with n. The second question concerns
the curious coincidence between the form of the Fundamental Plane and the
coupling between <I>_e and r_e when modelling a light profile. We explain,
through a mathematical analysis of the S\'ersic law, why the quantity
r_e<I>_e^{0.7} appears almost constant for an individual galaxy, regardless of
the value of n (over a large range) adopted in the fit to the light profile.
Consequently, Fundamental Planes of the form r_e<I>_e^{0.7} propto sigma_0^x
(for any x, and where sigma_0 is the central galaxy velocity dispersion) are
insensitive to galaxy structure. Finally, we address the problematic issue of
the use of model-dependent galaxy light profile parameters versus
model-independent quantities for the half-light radii, mean surface brightness
and total galaxy magnitude. The former implicitly assume that the light profile
model can be extrapolated to infinity, while the latter quantities, in general,
are derived from a signal-to-noise truncated profile. We quantify
(mathematically) how these parameters change as one reduces the outer radius of
an r^{1/n} profile, and reveal how these can vary substantially when n>4.",0.29948365688323975,0.8632147312164307,,"early, galaxies, magnitude, previous, type","bias, introduced, fixed, apertures, determining, color, magnitude, relation, early, type, galaxies, motivate, extend, previous, studies, topic","Motivation, Extends",,2025-09-15T14:25:10.823959

display images of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the simulations that
illustrate its evolution and provide a qualitative understanding of the
processes responsible for various biases that develop. We consider three
specific statistical measures of clustering at z=1 and z=0: the correlation
length (in real- and redshift-space) of galaxies of different luminosity, the
morphology-density relation and the genus curve of the topology of galaxy
isodensity surfaces. For galaxies with luminosity below L*, the z=0 correlation
length depends very little on the luminosity of the sample, but for brighter
galaxies it increases very rapidly, reaching values in excess of 10Mpc/h. The
""accelerated"" dynamical evolution experienced by galaxies in rich clusters,
which is partly responsible for this effect, also results in a strong
morphology-density relation. Remarkably, this relation is already
well-established at z=1. The genus curves of the galaxies are significantly
different from the genus curves of the dark matter but this is not due to
genuine topological differences but rather to the sparse sampling of the
density field provided by galaxies. The predictions of our model at z=0 will be
tested by forthcoming data from the 2dF and Sloan galaxy surveys, and those at

expansion of the Universe, we need to measure accurately the surface brightness
profiles of the high-redshift galaxy sample. We, therefore, investigate the
effects of various sizes of point-spread-functions composed of telescope
diffraction, CCD pixel resolutions, and ground-based seeing on the measurements
of mean surface brightness. We have done the calculations using two synthetic
galaxies of effective radii of 0.70"" and 0.25"" with point-spread functions of
0.1, 0.3, and 0.9 arcseconds. We have also compared actual observations of
three high-redshift galaxies in the cluster Cl 1324 + 3011 (z = 0.76) made both
with the Keck telescopes in seeing of about 0.9"" and with HST which has a PSF
that is approximately ten times smaller. The conclusion is that HST data can be
used as far into the galaxy image as a Petrosian metric radius of eta = 1.3
magnitudes, whereas the ground-based data will have systematic errors of up to
2.9 magnitudes in the mean surface brightness at eta values of less than 2.2
magnitudes. In the final section, we compare the differences in derived average
surface brightness for nearly circular galaxy images compared with highly
flattened images. The comparison is made by using the two reduction procedures
of (1) integrating the profile curves using circular apertures, and (2)
approximating an ``equivalent circular'' galaxy that is highly elongated by
using an ``effective'' radius of sqrt{ab}, where a and b are the semi-major and
semi-minor axis, respectively, of the best-fitting ellipse. The conclusion is
that the two methods of reduction give nearly identical results and that either
method can be used to analyze the low and high-redshift galaxy samples used in

poor statistics. The color offset of the Coma is analogous to that previously
found in I_T-H_{-0.5}. From the present calibration of H-band IRTF, we obtain
the distance to the Coma cluster to be m-M=34.94 +/- 0.13mag, where no account

universe averaged over the whole population of galaxies by means of a series of
chemo-spectrophotometric models that take into account the metallicity and dust
obscuration effects. We investigate various classes of cosmic star formation
rates (CSFR) histories consistent with current estimations. We are able to
reproduce a variety of observational constraints such as the emissivities at
rest-frame 0.44, 25, 60 and 100 $\mu$m of the local universe and also the
overall shape of the extragalactic background light from UV/NIR galaxy counts
and the cosmic infrared background (CIB) from DIRBE/FIRAS measurements. We find
that the CIB at 140 $\mu$m is crucial for discriminating between the CSFR
histories. The best-fit model to this constraint seems to favour mid-infrared
derived CSFR at low-$z$ and a flat CSFR at higher $z$ consistent with the most
recent estimations, although the shape of the CSFR at high redshifts has little
impact on the FIR/submm part of extragalactic background. We suggest that the
bulk of the CIB energy is produced by a population of moderately obscured
normal galaxies lying at $0\le z \le 1$. We then derive the global chemical
enrichment and stellar content of the universe and find that this model
predicts metallicities in good agreement with the metallicity in DLAs given

Surface brightness averages are calculated at various metric radii in each

have the Tolman signal incorporated are required to calculate linear radii and
absolute magnitudes from the observed data, the test is nevertheless free from
the hermeneutical circularity dilemma occasionally claimed in the literature.
The reasons are the observed mean surface brightness (1) is independent of any
assumptions of cosmological model, (2) does not depend on the existence of a

angular radii and apparent magnitudes, and (3) can be used to search for the

Omega_lambda) cosmology, absolute calibration of the total mass deduced from
lens modelling. Recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of galaxy
clusters reveal a large number of multiple images, which are predicted to be at
different redshifts. If it is possible to measure spectroscopically the
redshifts of many multiple images then one can in principle constrain
(Omega_m,Omega_lambda) through ratios of angular diameter distances,
independently of any external assumptions. For a regular/relaxed cluster
observed by HST with 3 multiple image systems, each with different
spectroscopic redshifts, we show by analytic calculation that the following

the well-studied Pearson-Readhead (PR) survey, and is ideally suited for
investigating the general effects of relativistic beaming in compact radio
sources. In addition to confirming many previously known correlations, we have
discovered several new trends that lend additional support to the beaming
model. These trends suggest that the most highly beamed sources in
core-selected samples tend to have a) high optical polarizations; b) large
pc/kpc-scale jet misalignments; c) prominent VLBI core components; d)
one-sided, core, or halo radio morphology on kiloparsec scales; e) narrow
emission line equivalent widths; and f) a strong tendency for intraday
variability at radio wavelengths. We have used higher resolution space and
ground-based VLBI maps to confirm the bi-modality of the jet misalignment
distribution for the PR survey, and find that the sources with aligned parsec-
and kiloparsec-scale jets generally have arcsecond-scale radio emission on both

We find evidence that the BL Lacertae objects in the PR survey are all highly
beamed, and have very similar properties to the high-optically polarized

  Lambda-CDM Universe",2001,Kentaro NagamineMasataka FukugitaRenyue CenJeremiah P. Ostriker,"The luminosity function of galaxies is derived from a cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation of a Lambda cold dark matter (CDM) universe with the
aid of a stellar population synthesis model. At z=0, the resulting B band
luminosity function has a flat faint end slope of \alpha \approx -1.15 with the
characteristic luminosity and the normalization in a fair agreement with
observations, while the dark matter halo mass function is steep with a slope of
\alpha \approx -2. The colour distribution of galaxies also agrees well with
local observations. We also discuss the evolution of the luminosity function,
and the colour distribution of galaxies from z=0 to 5. A large evolution of the
characteristic mass in the stellar mass function due to number evolution is
compensated by luminosity evolution; the characteristic luminosity increases
only by 0.8 mag from z=0 to 2, and then declines towards higher redshift, while
the B band luminosity density continues to increase from z=0 to 5 (but only
slowly at z>3).",0.11189627647399902,0.8539379239082336,galaxies,galaxies,"bias, introduced, fixed, apertures, determining, color, magnitude, relation, early, type, galaxies, motivate, extend, previous, studies, topic","Motivation, Extends",,2025-09-15T14:25:10.823959
18,astro-ph/0102450,Cepheid and SNIa Distance Scales,2001,T. ShanksP. D. AllenF. HoyleN. R. Tanvir,"We first discuss why there remains continuing, strong motivation to
investigate Hubble's Constant. Then we review new evidence from an
investigation of the Galactic Open Clusters containing Cepheids by Hoyle et al.
that the metallicity dependence of the Cepheid P-L relation is stronger than
expected. This result is supported by a new analysis of mainly HST Distance
Scale Key Project data which shows a correlation between host galaxy
metallicity and the rms scatter around the Cepheid P-L relation. If Cepheids do
have a significant metallicity dependence then an already existing scale error
for Tully-Fisher distances becomes worse and the distances of the Virgo and
Fornax clusters extend to more than 20Mpc, decreasing the value of H_0.
Finally, if the Cepheids have a metallicity dependence then so do Type Ia
Supernovae since the metallicity corrected Cepheid distances to eight galaxies
with SNIa now suggests that the SNIa peak luminosity is fainter in metal poor
galaxies. As well as having important implications for H_0, this would also
imply that the evidence for a non-zero cosmological constant from the SNIa
Hubble Diagram may be subject to corrections for metallicity which are as big
as the effects of cosmology.",0.10218539834022522,0.8534576892852783,,"extend, galaxies, relation, type","bias, introduced, fixed, apertures, determining, color, magnitude, relation, early, type, galaxies, motivate, extend, previous, studies, topic","Motivation, Extends",,2025-09-15T14:25:10.823959
19,astro-ph/0101143,On the trispectrum as a gaussian test for cosmology,2001,Licia VerdeAlan F. Heavens,"In the standard model for structure formation, bound objects originate from
the gravitational collapse of small perturbations arising from quantum
fluctuations with random phases. In other scenarios, based on defects,
structures are seeded by localized energy density. In principle, it is possible
to differentiate between these models on the basis of their statistical
properties; only in the former case is the initial density field an
almost-perfect random gaussian field. In this paper, we investigate the use of
the trispectrum of the galaxy density field, which is the connected four-point
function in Fourier space, as a discriminant between gaussian and non-gaussian
models. It has the advantage of having only weak non-linear growth. We define a
related statistic $\tau$ which, as a test of the gaussian hypothesis, is
independent of cosmology, the power spectrum and biasing, in real space, and
which is, in principle, a measure of the departure from gaussian statistics.
For galaxy redshift surveys, the statistic depends on cosmology and bias only
through the potentially observable parameter $\beta$. We compute the expected
errors on the estimate of $\tau$, and demonstrate with numerical simulations
that it can be a useful discriminant of models, with the important proviso that
any bias is linear on large scales. Whether it is the most effective method is
uncertain and depends on the nature of the departure from gaussianity.",0.10060649365186691,0.8533796072006226,,bias,"bias, introduced, fixed, apertures, determining, color, magnitude, relation, early, type, galaxies, motivate, extend, previous, studies, topic","Motivation, Extends",,2025-09-15T14:25:10.823959
