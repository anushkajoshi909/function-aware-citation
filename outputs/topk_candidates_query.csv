  and Ra II",2001,V. A. DzubaV. V. FlambaumJ. S. M. Ginges,"We have performed ab initio mixed-states and sum-over-states calculations of
parity nonconserving (PNC) electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes between
s-d electron states of Cs, Fr, Ba II, and Ra II. For the lower states of these
atoms we have also calculated energies, E1 transition amplitudes, and
lifetimes. We have shown that PNC E1 transition amplitudes between s-d states
can be calculated to high accuracy. Contrary to the Cs 6s-7s transition, in
these transitions there are no strong cancelations between different terms in
the sum-over-states approach. In fact, there is one dominating term which
deviates from the sum by less than 20%. This term corresponds to an s-p_{1/2}
weak matrix element, which can be calculated to better than 1%, and a
p_{1/2}-d_{3/2} E1 transition amplitude, which can be measured. Also, the s-d
amplitudes are about four times larger than the corresponding s-s transitions.
We have shown that by using a hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach the
accuracy of the calculations of PNC s-d amplitudes could compete with that of
Cs 6s-7s if p_{1/2}-d_{3/2} E1 amplitudes are measured to high accuracy.",1.0,0.8880318403244019,,"amplitudes, hybrid, mixed, pnc, states, sum","hybrid, mixed, states, sum, states, compare, previous, extend, calculation, pnc, amplitudes","Compares, Extends",,2025-09-09T18:03:58.180609

describe nuclear effects, since it allows to apply Glauber multiple scattering
theory. We go beyond the Glauber eikonal approximation by taking into account
transitions between interaction eigenstates. We calculate nuclear shadowing at

10%) over a significant range of the neutralino mass of up to several tens of
GeV which is caused by the presence of resonances and new final-state

  width",2001,Gorazd CveticTaekoon Lee,"The singular part of Borel transform of a QCD amplitude near the infrared
renormalon can be expanded in terms of higher order Wilson coefficients of the
operators associated with the renormalon. In this paper we observe that this
expansion gives nontrivial constraints on the Borel amplitude that can be used
to improve the accuracy of the ordinary perturbative expansion of the Borel
amplitude. In particular, we consider the Borel transform of the Adler function
and its expansion around the first infrared renormalon due to the gluon
condensate. Using the next-to-leading order Wilson coefficient of the gluon
condensate operator, we obtain an exact constraint on the Borel amplitude at
the first IR renormalon. We then extrapolate, using judiciously chosen
conformal transformations and Pade approximants, the ordinary perturbative
expansion of the Borel amplitude in such a way that this constraint is
satisfied. This procedure allows us to predict the $O(\alpha_s^4)$ coefficient
of the Adler function, which gives a result consistent with the estimate by
Kataev and Starshenko using a completely different method. We then apply this
improved Borel amplitude to the tau decay width, and obtain the strong coupling
constant $\alpha_s(M_Z) =0.1193 \pm 0.0007_{exp.} \pm 0.0010_{EW+CKM} \pm

11,hep-ph/0104206,Model-independent approach as a tool of studying chiral symmetry,2001,Yu. S. SurovtsevD. KrupaM. Nagy,"A simultaneous analysis (in the model-independent approach) of the $\pi\pi$
scattering (from the threshold to 1.9 GeV) and of the $\pi\pi\to K\overline{K}$
process (from the threshold to $\sim$ 1.46 GeV) is carried out in channel with
$I^GJ^{PC}=0^+0^{++}$. The existence of the $f_0(665)$ state with properies of
the $\sigma$-meson is proved. An indication for the glueball nature of the
$f_0(1500)$ is obtained. A minimum scenario of the simultaneous description of
the processes $\pi\pi\to\pi\pi,K\overline{K}$ does without the ${f_0}(1370)$
resonance. A version including this state is also considered. In this case the
${f_0}(1370)$ resonance has the dominant $s{\bar s}$ component (the ratio of
its coupling constant with the $\pi\pi$ channel to the one with the
$K\overline{K}$ channel is 0.12). The coupling constants of the observed states
with the $\pi\pi$ and $K\overline{K}$ systems and the $\pi\pi$ and
$K\overline{K}$ scattering lengths are obtained. A parameterless description of
the $\pi\pi$ background is given by allowance for the left-hand branch-point in
the uniformizing variable. On the basis of this and of the fact that all the
adjusted parameters for the $\pi\pi$ scattering are only the positions of poles
describing resonances, it is concluded that our model-independent approach is a
valuable tool for studying the realization schemes of chiral symmetry. The
existence of the $f_0(665)$ state and the obtained $\pi\pi$-scattering length
($a_0^0\approx 0.27 m_{\pi^+}^{-1}$) seem to suggest the linear realization of
