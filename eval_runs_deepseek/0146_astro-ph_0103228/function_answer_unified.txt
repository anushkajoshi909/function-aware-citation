The RIMH models, which arise from SUSY SO(10) grand unified theories, provide a promising approach to solving the SUSY flavor and CP problems [Background] (hep-ph/0102156). They offer a decoupling solution to these problems, although with limitations on the magnitude of the hierarchy that can be generated, and have implications for experimental searches at the Tevatron and LHC [Background] (hep-ph/0102156).
