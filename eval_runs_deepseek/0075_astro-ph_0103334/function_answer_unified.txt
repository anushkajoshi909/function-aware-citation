The investigation of magnetic field fluctuations in the NGC 7538 region is motivated by the differences in polarization between the IRS 1(SMM) and IRS 11(SMM) cores, suggesting small scale fluctuations are more prominent in IRS 1(SMM) [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103334). The observations of polarization are used to understand these fluctuations, as the distribution of magnetic field directions derived from the polarization map agrees with those of molecular outflows, indicating the magnetic field plays a role in guiding the outflows [Uses] (astro-ph/0103334).
