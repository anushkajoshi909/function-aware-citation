The current X-ray spectral analysis of Seyfert 2 galaxies extends previous work by deriving the basic spectral and timing properties of X-ray detected Seyfert galaxies [Extends] (astro-ph/0101184), and motivates further investigation into the nature of these galaxies due to the indications of X-ray flux variations and high far-infrared luminosity suggesting strong star formation [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101184).
