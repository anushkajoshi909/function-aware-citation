The study of the exclusive decay of heavy quarkonium is motivated by the potential to gain insight into how gluons are converted into pions [Motivation] (hep-ph/0103225). Understanding this process requires background knowledge of nonperturbative effects in heavy quarkonium and pion systems, including non-relativistic QCD matrix elements and distribution amplitudes [Background] (hep-ph/0103225).
