The current work builds upon existing methods for studying superfluid properties of bosons on a lattice, extending the Beliaev-Popov formalism to account for a deformable lattice [Background] (cond-mat/0103055). It utilizes this extended framework to examine the effects of phonon-mediated interactions on the superfluid state, demonstrating the robustness of superfluidity in the presence of lattice deformations [Background] (cond-mat/0103055).
