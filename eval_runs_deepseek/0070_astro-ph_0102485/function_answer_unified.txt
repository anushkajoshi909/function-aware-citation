The properties of SNe II-L and SNe IIn extend our understanding of supernovae by showing evidence of late-time interaction with circumstellar material and unusually dense circumstellar gas [Extends] (astro-ph/0102485). These types of supernovae compare to other types, such as SNe Ib and SNe Ic, in terms of their spectral characteristics and asymmetries in the ejecta [Compares] (astro-ph/0102485).
