The revisitation of the OGLE database provides background information on the properties of Fourier parameters in different types of stars [Background] (astro-ph/0103498). The investigation uses previous methods to analyze the properties of Fourier parameters as a function of physical conditions in the stars, leading to a clearer separation among High-Amplitude Delta Scuti, RRc, and RRab stars [Background] (astro-ph/0103498).
