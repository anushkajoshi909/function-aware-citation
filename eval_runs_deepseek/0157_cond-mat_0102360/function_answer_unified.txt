The current work extends previous studies on the stability of poloidal magnetic fields in accretion discs by numerically confirming the existence of the interchange instability and finding a global instability that transports angular momentum outward [Background] (astro-ph/0103409). This instability is compared to previous predictions from the shearing sheet model, which suggested that discs with Keplerian rotation are stabilized by the shear, and is found to be relevant in jet-producing discs [Extends] (astro-ph/0103409).
