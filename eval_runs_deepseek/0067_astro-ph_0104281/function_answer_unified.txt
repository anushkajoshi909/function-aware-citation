The X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151, being one of the flattest among Seyfert galaxies, motivates the development of a two-phase model [Background] (astro-ph/0104281). This model is supported by the expectation that such flat X-ray spectra favor the presence of two gas phases in pressure equilibrium, which is consistent with the observed properties of NGC 4151 [Background] (astro-ph/0104281).
