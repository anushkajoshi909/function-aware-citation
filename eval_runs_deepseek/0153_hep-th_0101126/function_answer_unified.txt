The current limitations of M-theory, including the lack of a complete background-independent formulation [Background] (hep-th/0101126), motivate future research directions to reconcile gravity and quantum field theory in a realistic fashion. Further investigation is needed to address these limitations and develop a more comprehensive theory [Background] (hep-th/0101126).
