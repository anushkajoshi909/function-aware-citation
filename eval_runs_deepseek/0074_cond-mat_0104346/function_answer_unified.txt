The investigation of MgB$_2$ is motivated by its potential for higher superconducting transition temperatures, which is influenced by its electronic properties, particularly the density of states around the Fermi level [Background] (cond-mat/0104098). MgB$_2$ is compared to other diborides, such as Mg$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$B$_2$ and Mg$_{1-x}$Al$_x$B$_2$, in terms of how doping affects its electronic properties and superconducting transition temperature [Background] (cond-mat/0104098).
