The re-examination of global axisymmetric stability in the context of magnetorotational instabilities is motivated by the need to understand flows that are hydrodynamically stable according to Rayleigh's criterion, yet may still exhibit instabilities [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104206). Understanding this re-examination requires background knowledge of magnetorotational instabilities, including their potential occurrence in flows with opposing gradients of angular velocity and specific angular momentum, and the importance of experimental studies in this area [Background] (astro-ph/0104206).
