The current work's method of deriving the color-magnitude relation compares to previous methods by accounting for internal radial color gradients, which introduces a bias in the traditional color-magnitude relation [Compares] (astro-ph/0102090). It uses a sample of 48 giant early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster with CCD observations in the U- and V-band to achieve this comparison [Uses] (astro-ph/0102090).
