The limitations in identifying gamma-ray sources, such as unsuccessful efforts to detect predicted fluxes from supernova remnants, motivate further research [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101175). Future work may involve using X-ray studies of supernova remnants to guide the search for gamma-ray sources, by identifying properties that lead to gamma-ray emission [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0104348).
