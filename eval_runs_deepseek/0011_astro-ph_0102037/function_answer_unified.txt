VLBI's capability to image large fields-of-view with sub-mJy detection limits provides background for understanding cosmologically distant sources by distinguishing between starburst and AGN activity [Background] (astro-ph/0102037). This capability extends our understanding of these sources by enabling the measurement of brightness temperature distributions, which can reveal high-brightness-temperature components and inform models of relativistic jets [Extends] (astro-ph/0101313).
