The limitations in current understanding of quantum communication and entanglement, such as the restricted experimental confirmation of entanglement to qubits [Motivation] (quant-ph/0104070), motivate further research into their potential to enhance classical communication efficiency, given the background that quantum communication can be more efficient than its classical counterpart when entanglement is involved [Background] (quant-ph/0101005).
