The study of KK graviton self-interactions at a future Graviton Factory extends our understanding of the 5-d Randall-Sundrum model by probing the accuracy of the 5-d Einstein gravity picture [Extends] (hep-ph/0104199). This research also suggests areas for future work, such as measuring the decays of heavier states to lighter ones and studying the sensitivity to higher derivative operators [FutureWork] (hep-ph/0104199).
