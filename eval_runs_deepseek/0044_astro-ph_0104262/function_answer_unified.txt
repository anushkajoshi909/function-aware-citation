The study models irradiated planets near different primary stars, finding that the atmospheric structure and emergent spectrum strongly depend on the presence or absence of dust clouds [Background] (astro-ph/0104262). The effects of irradiation in this study compare to other models by indicating that planets without dust opacity are brighter in the optical than dusty planets, with results consistent with recently reported upper limit values [Compares] (astro-ph/0104262).
