The limitations of current gravitational lensing methods in predicting the maximum number of images produced by n-tuple lenses motivate further research [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103463). Future work may involve investigating strong gravitational lensing by multiple galaxies, including the effects of external shear and aligned discs on image configurations and magnification cross sections [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103093).
