The method of polarisation conversion of electromagnetic waves in 2D electron systems can be utilized in future research for polarisation spectroscopy applications by leveraging the high polarisation conversion efficiency achieved under cyclotron resonance conditions [Background] (cond-mat/0101072). This phenomenon enables extremely high polarisation conversion in a wide range of angles, making it a promising tool for polarisation spectroscopy of 2D electron systems [Background] (cond-mat/0101072).
