The spectroscopic survey of faint lensed galaxies in the core of the galaxy cluster AC114 extends the work of Natarajan et al by confirming predicted lensing redshifts and discovering new multiple-image systems [Background] (astro-ph/0104477). This survey motivates further research on the faint end of the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies by demonstrating a large gain in sensitivity towards low luminosity high-z objects [Extends] (astro-ph/0104477).
