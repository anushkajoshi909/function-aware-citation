The current work builds upon earlier research on cosmic microwave background anisotropies by utilizing datasets from experiments like the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) [Background] (astro-ph/0101086). This allows for the extension of previous studies by constraining parameterized models and examining model-independent constraints on various cosmological parameters [Extends] (astro-ph/0101086).
