The electronic properties of thick metallic silver films deposited on Si(111)-(7x7) substrates at room temperature have a background structure characterized by a two-domains bulklike Fermi surface [Background] (cond-mat/0104186). These properties compare to the expected properties by exhibiting a sixfold symmetry instead of the threefold symmetry of Ag single crystal, indicating a loss of symmetry due to the presence of two sets of domains rotated 60$^o$ from each other [Compares] (cond-mat/0104186).
