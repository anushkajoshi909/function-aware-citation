The concept of discrete scalar fields compares to existing theories such as MOND and Tsallis statistics [Compares] by potentially putting MOND on a more solid physical basis and being regarded as proper for discrete-interaction systems described by Tsallis statistics (hep-th/0103218). It utilizes these theories [Uses] by introducing an effective-acceleration scale and regarding Tsallis statistics as a measure of how close a system is to its idealized asymptotic state (hep-th/0103218).
