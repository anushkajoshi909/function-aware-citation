The current work extends existing models by analyzing the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model with baryon and lepton number violation, studying its renormalization group evolution and infrared stable fixed points [Extends] (hep-ph/0103005). It uses the model to catalogue baryon and lepton number violating operators and study their quasi-fixed point behavior [Uses] (hep-ph/0103005).
