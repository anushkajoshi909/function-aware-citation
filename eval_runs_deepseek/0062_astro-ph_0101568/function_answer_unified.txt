The work on the self-gravitating non-relativistic gas at thermal equilibrium motivates further research by providing a complete picture of the system's thermodynamic limit and phase diagram [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101568). It extends previous research by computing the equation of state and analyzing various physical quantities, which depend on a single variable eta, and exhibits a collapse phase transition in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles [Extends] (astro-ph/0101568).
