The discovery of the 29 keV Cyclotron Resonant Scattering Feature in 4U 0352+309 extends previous research on X-ray pulsars by providing new insights into the properties of low-luminosity X-ray pulsars [Extends] (astro-ph/0101110), and uses established methods for spectral analysis, including continuum models and phase-resolved analysis, to characterize the feature [Uses] (astro-ph/0101110).
