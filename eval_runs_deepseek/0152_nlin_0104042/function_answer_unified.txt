The study on the coexistence of two scaling regimes in shear dominated flows builds upon previous work by providing evidence of the coexistence of the classical Kolmogorov-like inertial range and the shear dominated range [Background] (nlin/0104042). This finding suggests future research directions, including the theoretical prediction of scaling exponents of structure functions in the shear dominated range, which is supported by the available numerical and experimental data [Background] (nlin/0104042).
