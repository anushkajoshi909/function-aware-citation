The late-time behavior of a dynamically perturbed rapidly rotating black hole provides background for understanding its implications by exhibiting a unique oscillating "tail" with an amplitude that decays as 1/t at late times for extreme Kerr black holes [Background] (gr-qc/0103054). This behavior suggests areas for future research on gravitational-wave signals, as the required theoretical templates need to be constructed from linear combinations of many modes [Background] (gr-qc/0103054).
