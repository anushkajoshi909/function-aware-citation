  "answer": "The proposed model extends existing theories on blazar flares by considering the radiation mechanisms and comparing with observed flare behaviors, as seen in astro-ph/0101380, which discusses the synchrotron-self Compton mechanism (astro-ph/0101380).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0101380",
  "explanation": "This paper best supports the answer because it discusses the radiation mechanisms and compares with observed flare behaviors, providing a clear understanding of the proposed model's extension of existing theories.",
