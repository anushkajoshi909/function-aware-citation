Analysis of Source Properties", "abstract": "We have performed a multi-dimensional correlation analysis on the observed\nproperties of a statistically complete core-selected sample of compact\nradio-loud active galactic nuclei, based on data from the VLBI Space Observing\nProgramme (Paper I) and previously published studies. Our sample is drawn from\nthe well-studied Pearson-Readhead (PR) survey, and is ideally suited for\ninvestigating the general effects of relativistic beaming in compact radio\nsources. In addition to confirming many previously known correlations, we have\ndiscovered several new trends that lend additional support to the beaming\nmodel. These trends suggest that the most highly beamed sources in\ncore-selected samples tend to have a) high optical polarizations; b) large\npc/kpc-scale jet misalignments; c) prominent VLBI core components; d)\none-sided, core, or halo radio morphology on kiloparsec scales; e) narrow\nemission line equivalent widths; and f) a strong tendency for intraday\nvariability at radio wavelengths. We have used higher resolution space and\nground-based VLBI maps to confirm the bi-modality of the jet misalignment\ndistribution for the PR survey, and find that the sources with aligned parsec-\nand kiloparsec-scale jets generally have arcsecond-scale radio emission on both\nsides of the core. The aligned sources also have broader emission line widths.\nWe find evidence that the BL Lacertae objects in the PR survey are all highly\nbeamed, and have very similar properties to the high-optically polarized\nquasars, with the exception of smaller redshifts. A cluster analysis on our\ndata shows that after partialing out the effects of redshift, the luminosities\nof our sample objects in various wave bands are generally well-correlated with\neach other, but not with other source properties.", "abstract_full": "We have performed a multi-dimensional correlation analysis on the observed\nproperties of a statistically complete core-selected sample of compact\nradio-loud active galactic nuclei, based on data from the VLBI Space Observing\nProgramme (Paper I) and previously published studies.
