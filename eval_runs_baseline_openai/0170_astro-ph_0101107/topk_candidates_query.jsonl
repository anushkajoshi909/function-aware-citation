The main evolutionary features of these models are\ndiscussed, also in comparison with models of non-zero metallicity. Among\nseveral interesting aspects, particular attention has been paid to describe: i)\nthe first synthesis of 12C inside the stars, that may suddenly trigger the\nCNO-cycle causing particular evolutionary features; ii) the pollution of the\nstellar surface by the dredge-up events, that are effective only within\nparticular mass ranges; iii) the mass limits which conventionally define the\nclasses of low-, intermediate-, and high-mass stars on the basis of common\nevolutionary properties, including the upper mass limit for the achievement of\nsuper-Eddington luminosities before C-ignition in the high-mass regime; and iv)\nthe expected pulsational properties of zero-metallicity stars.

Calculations are carried out at constant mass, with updated input\nphysics, and applying an overshooting scheme to convective boundaries. The\nnuclear network includes all the important reactions of the p-p chain,\nCNO-cycle and alpha-captures, and is solved by means of a suitable\nsemi-implicit method. The evolution is followed up to the thermally pulsing AGB\nin the case of low- and intermediate-mass stars, or to the onset of carbon\nburning in massive stars.
