  "answer": "Future research directions are motivated by the limitations of M-theory and matrix theory, such as formulating matrix theory in a general space-time background (hep-th/0101126).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "hep-th/0101126",
  "explanation": "This paper provides a self-contained review of the matrix model of M-theory and discusses the problem of formulating matrix theory in a general space-time background, which is a current limitation of the theory.",
  "evidence_quote": "no complete background-independent formulation of the theory yet exists",
