  "answer": "Future research might extend the current understanding of wind-driven instability in accretion disks by investigating the effects of hydrodynamical winds on the disk structure and stability, as seen in astro-ph/0102119.",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0102119",
  "explanation": "This paper studies the influence of hydrodynamical winds on hot accretion disk solutions and finds that the presence of a wind can lead to a new type of instability called 'wind driven instability'.",
