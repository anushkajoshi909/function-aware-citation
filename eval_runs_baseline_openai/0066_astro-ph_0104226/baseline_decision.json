  "answer": "The current study's use of a 2-D hydro code is compared to other approaches in understanding the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarfs, utilizing an implicit 2-D hydro code to study multi-dimensional effects during the final hours prior to the thermonuclear runaway (astro-ph/0104226).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0104226",
  "explanation": "This paper is relevant because it presents a study of multi-dimensional effects during the final hours prior to the thermonuclear runaway in Type Ia Supernovae, which are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of massive white dwarfs.",
