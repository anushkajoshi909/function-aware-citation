We have\nconsidered muon polarization in K_L to mu+ mu- and K to pi mu+ mu- decays.\nAlthough the effects are small, or difficult to measure because of the small\nbranching ratios involved, these studies could provide clean measurements of\nthe CKM parameters. The experimental difficulty appears comparable to the\nobservation of K to pi nu barnu. New sources of physics, involving non-standard\nCP violation, could produce effects observable in these measurements. Limits\nfrom new results on the neutron and electron electric dipole moment, and\nepsilon-prime over epsilon in neutral kaon decays, do not eliminate certain\nmodels that could contribute to the signal. A detailed examination of muon\npolarization out of the decay plane in KMU3 and radiative KMU2 decays also\nappears to be of interest.
