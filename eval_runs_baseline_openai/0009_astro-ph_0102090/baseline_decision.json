  "answer": "The current work's method of deriving the color-magnitude relation is compared to previous methods using data from the Coma cluster, which achieves this comparison by deriving a CM relation based on color measurements within the effective radius (astro-ph/0102090).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0102090",
  "explanation": "This paper is relevant because it discusses the derivation of the color-magnitude relation using a sample of giant early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster, which is similar to the context of the current work.",
