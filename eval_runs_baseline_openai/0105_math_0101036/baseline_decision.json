  "answer": "Geometrical stability theory provides background for the study of homogeneous models and extends the theory to non-saturated structures by introducing a notion of independence (math/0101036).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "math/0101036",
  "explanation": "This paper studies strongly lambda-homogeneous models and introduces a notion of independence that agrees with forking independence when the model is saturated, extending geometrical stability theory to non-saturated structures.",
