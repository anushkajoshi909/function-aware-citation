  "answer": "The electronic properties of thick metallic silver films deposited on Si(111)-(7x7) substrates at room temperature exhibit a sixfold symmetry instead of the expected threefold symmetry, as seen in cond-mat/0104186.",
  "predicted_paper_id": "cond-mat/0104186",
  "explanation": "This paper directly studies the electronic properties of silver films on Si(111)-(7x7) substrates, making it the most relevant to the question.",
  "evidence_quote": "Thick metallic silver films have been deposited onto Si(111)-(7x7) substrates",
