  "answer": "The current work uses a method from a previous study to compare the supersymmetry of different deformed D2-brane solutions (hep-th/0101096).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "hep-th/0101096",
  "explanation": "This paper provides regular deformed D2-brane solutions with fractional D2-branes and discusses their supersymmetry, making it relevant to the question.",
