  "answer": "The current work extends previous research on the magnetic state of doped SrB$_{6}$ by investigating the electronic structure and magnetism in slightly doped SrB$_{6}$ (cond-mat/0103180).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "cond-mat/0103180",
  "explanation": "This paper is relevant because it studies the electronic structure and magnetism in slightly doped SrB$_{6}$, which is directly related to the question about the magnetic state of doped SrB$_{6}$.",
