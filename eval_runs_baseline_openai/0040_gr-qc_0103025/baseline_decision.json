  "answer": "The development of preferred-frame theory is motivated by the need to account for special relativity and reduce to it if the gravitation field cancels, as seen in gr-qc/0103025.",
  "predicted_paper_id": "gr-qc/0103025",
  "explanation": "This paper provides a clear motivation for the development of preferred-frame theory, based on an interpretation of gravity as a pressure force and the need to extend special-relativistic form of Newton's second law.",
