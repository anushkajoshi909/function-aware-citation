  "answer": "The effects of irradiation on planetary atmospheres are compared to other models in astro-ph/0104262, which finds that large errors result from models not including impinging radiation in a self-consistent manner (astro-ph/0104262).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0104262",
  "explanation": "This paper directly addresses the effects of irradiation on planetary atmospheres and compares the results to other models, making it the most relevant to the question.",
