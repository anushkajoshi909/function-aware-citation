  "answer": "The methods used to analyze the absorption feature in GRB 990705 could inform future research on supernova remnants and their impact on afterglow generation by considering the physical conditions and geometry of the absorbing material, such as a young supernova remnant surrounding the burst site (astro-ph/0104062).",
