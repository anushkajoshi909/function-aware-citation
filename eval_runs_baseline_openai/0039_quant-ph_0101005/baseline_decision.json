  "answer": "Current understanding of quantum communication and entanglement has limitations that motivate further research, such as the possibility of communicating more than n bits of classical information by the transmission of n quantum bits when entangled, as seen in quant-ph/0101005.",
  "predicted_paper_id": "quant-ph/0101005",
  "explanation": "This paper best supports the answer because it discusses the potential of entanglement to enhance classical communication efficiency and highlights the limitations of current understanding in this area.",
  "evidence_quote": "unless the two parties are entangled",
