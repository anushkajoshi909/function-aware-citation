  "answer": "The concept of discrete scalar fields utilizes existing theories such as MOND and Tsallis statistics, as seen in the discussion of a critical point that may put Milgrom's MOND on a more solid physical basis (hep-th/0103218).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "hep-th/0103218",
  "explanation": "This paper discusses the physical meaning and properties of discrete scalar fields, including their relation to general relativity and the introduction of an effective-acceleration scale that may support MOND, as well as contact with Tsallis generalized statistics.",
  "evidence_quote": "the introduction of an effective-acceleration scale which may put Milgrom's MOND",
