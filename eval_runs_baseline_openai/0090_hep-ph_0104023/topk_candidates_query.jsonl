We obtain a\nprobability of the order of 1/1000 at CERN SPS energies. Next, we study the\ncorrelation between isospin orientations of the distinct modes of the pion\nfield emerging after a quench. We show that this correlation is absent: the\ndistinct modes behave as distinct DCCs. This contradicts the common belief that\nthe state produced in the simplest form of the quench scenario - with a fully\nthermalized initial state - is identical to the originally proposed DCC. In the\nsecond part, we investigate the role of elastic scatterings in the process of\nkinetic equilibration of gluons produced in the very early times of the\ncollision.
