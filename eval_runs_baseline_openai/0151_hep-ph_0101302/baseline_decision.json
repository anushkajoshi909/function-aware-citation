  "answer": "The work extends previous lattice estimates by applying the operator product expansion to predict physical quantities, which requires high-order perturbative calculations (hep-ph/0101302).",

  "explanation": "This paper shows that the OPE can be applied in predicting physical quantities only if the Wilson coefficients are computed to a high enough perturbative order.",
