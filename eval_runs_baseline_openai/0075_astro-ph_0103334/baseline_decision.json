  "answer": "The investigation of magnetic field fluctuations in the NGC 7538 region is motivated by the need to understand the differences in polarization between IRS 1(SMM) and IRS 11(SMM) (astro-ph/0103334).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "astro-ph/0103334",
  "explanation": "This paper presents imaging polarimetry of the 0.85mm continuum emission in the NGC 7538 region and interprets the polarization map in terms of thermal radiation by magnetically aligned dust grains.",
