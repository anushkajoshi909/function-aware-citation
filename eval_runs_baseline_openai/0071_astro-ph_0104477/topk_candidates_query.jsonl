These data\nare used to study cluster spatial extension by means of star counts, and to\nderive the luminosity (LF) and mass function (MF). The radius turns out to be\n$3.6\\pm0.3 arcmin$ at V=19.0 level, whereas the mass amounts at $880\\pm230\nm_{\\odot}$ down to V=20.8. From the color-magnitude diagram, we obtain the LFs\nin the V and I bands, using both the standard histogram and an adaptive kernel.\nAfter correction for incompleteness and field star contamination, the LFs have\nbeen transformed into the present day mass functions (PDMF). The PDMFs from the\nV and I photometry can be represented as a power-law with a slope $\\alpha =\n3.1\\pm0.3$ and $\\alpha = 2.9\\pm0.3$ (the \\cite{salp55} MF in this notation has\na slope $\\alpha = 2.35$) respectively, in the mass range $2.5 \\leq\n\\frac{m}{m_{\\odot}} \\leq 0.8$.

We find that the objects are typically of fairly low\nredshift (z ~ 0.1-0.2), but with a tail that extends to high redshifts. The\nhighest redshift object is a previously unknown quasar at z=1.2. The sample of\nobjects for which spectroscopy has been obtained forms a complete subsample of\nthe original survey with an R band magnitude limit of 19.6. We are thus able to\nuse accessible volume methods to determine the luminosity function. We find\nthat the luminosity function is close to the low redshift 12 micron luminosity\nfunction determined by IRAS (Fang et al., 1998; Rush et al., 1993), but with a\npossible excess at the highest luminosities, which also correspond to the\nhighest redshifts. This excess is compatible with the rapid luminosity\nevolution of L ~ (1+z)^{4.5} claimed by Xu (2000) and suggested by Elbaz (1999)\non the basis of number counts. These conclusions remain tentative because of\nsmall number statistics at the highest redshifts. Almost all of the galaxies in\nthis survey are emission line objects. We use the spectra to determine emission\nline diagnostics for the underlying ionisation source. We find that the\nmajority of objects have HII region-like spectra (roughly 2/3) but there is a\nsignificant fraction (about 1/3) that contain an AGN. This confirms suspicions\nthat deep mid-IR surveys will be a powerful way to find obscured AGN. Part of\nthe survey area has been imaged deeply by the INT Wide Field Camera.
