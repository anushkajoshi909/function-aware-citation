  "answer": "The PHOBOS experiment provides background information on Au-Au interactions at RHIC, including the initial configuration of the PHOBOS detector and the center of mass energy of 56 and 130 AGeV (hep-ex/0102012).",
  "predicted_paper_id": "hep-ex/0102012",
  "explanation": "This paper is the most relevant because it directly mentions the PHOBOS experiment and its study of Au-Au interactions at RHIC.",
