new optical spectra which reveal that it has a low-ionization nuclear
emission-line region (LINER) as well as broad Balmer emission lines,
establishing it as an active galactic nucleus. We also examined an older
spectrum from the CfA Redshift Survey which, lacking broad Balmer lines,
indicates that they appeared some time after 1980. Thus NGC 3065 joins the set
of LINERs with broad, variable Balmer lines, which includes such well-known
galaxies as NGC 1097 and M81. Inspired by the sometimes double-peaked profiles
of the variable Balmer lines in other LINERs, we speculate that the broad
Balmer lines of NGC 3065 also come from an accretion disk. We illustrate the
plausibility of this hypothesis by fitting a disk model to the observed
H$\alpha$ profile. We also estimate the mass of the central black hole as
(9+/-4) 10^7 M_sol from the properties of the host galaxy, which leads to the
conclusion that the accretion rate is only 2 10^{-4} times the Eddington value,
a property that appears to be common among LINERs. At such a low relative
accretion rate the inner accretion disk can turn into a vertically-extended ion
torus, which can illuminate the outer, thin disk and power the broad-line
emission. The reason for the sudden appearance of broad Balmer lines is an open
question, although we suggest two possible explanations: tidal disruption of a
star or a sudden transition in the structure of the accretion disk.","Motivated by the X-ray properties of the galaxy NGC 3065, we have obtained

Gaussian and/or Lorentzian profiles. In most cases, the broad Balmer components
are well fitted by a single Lorentzian profile. This has consequences
concerning their FWHMs and line ratios: when the broad Balmer components are
fitted with a Lorentzian, most narrow line regions have line ratios typical of
Seyfert 2s while, when a Gaussian profile isused for fitting the broad Balmer
components, the line ratios are widely scattered in the usual diagnostic
diagrams (Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987). We find that, in general, the [O III]

often, in addition, a second broad (~ 500-1800 km/s FWHM), blueshifted Gaussian

previously suggested, there is a continuous transition of all properties

CL1358+62 (z=0.33), MS2053--04 (z=0.58), and MS1054--03 (z=0.83). By comparing
the correlation of Balmer line strength with velocity dispersion for E/S0s in
the three clusters, we find moderate evolution in the zero-point of the

passive evolution of old stellar populations. Under the assumption that the

synthesis models to constrain the last major occurrences of star-formation in
the observed E/S0s to be z_f > 2.5 (95% confidence). We have compared the
evolution of the Balmer absorption with the evolution of the B-band fundamental

accretion rate, the bolometric luminosity, the optical luminosity and the size

accretion disc cannot account for the observed optical luminosity, unless it
radiates at super-Eddington rates. This implies the existence of another,
dominant emission mechanism in the optical range, or a non standard disc (non
stationary, ADAF and/or strong outflows). Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies
(NLS1s) are most extreme in this context: they have larger bolometric to
Eddington luminosity ratios than Broad Line Seyfert 1 (BLS1s), and most likely
a larger ""non disc"" component in the optical range. From realistic simulations
of self-gravitating $\alpha$-discs, we have systematically localized the
gravitationally unstable disc and shown that, given uncertainties on both the
model and observations, it coincides quite well with the size of the BLR. We
therefore suggest that the gravitationally unstable disc is the source which
releases BLR clouds in the medium. However the influence of the ionization
parameter is also required to explain the correlation found between the size of
the BLR and the luminosity. In this picture the size of the BLR in NLS1s

smaller) than in BLS1s simply because their Eddington ratio is larger.","We address the question of the relations between the black hole's mass, the

result, HII galaxies selected from objective-prism surveys are unlikely to

5~Myr. The observed increase of [OI]/Hb with decreasing W(Hb) can result from
the dynamical effects of winds and supernovae. This interpretation provides
also a natural explanation of the small range of ionization parameters in giant

Local Group satellites and the few known examples of debris trails in the
Galaxy and in external systems, we estimate that the best current techniques
could characterize the brightest ($R < 29$ mag/ arcsec$^{2}$) portions of the
youngest (3 dynamical periods) debris streamers. If systematics can be
controlled, planned large-aperture telescopes such as CELT and OWL may allow
fainter trails to be detected routinely and thus used for statistical studies
such as those required for tests of galaxy formation.","Kathryn V. Johnston, Penny D. Sackett, James S. Bullock",2001,2025-09-24T21:09:16,"Background, Motivation"

12,0.8311628103256226,astro-ph/0103503,MLAPM - a C code for cosmological simulations,"We present a computer code written in C that is designed to simulate
structure formation from collisionless matter. The code is purely grid-based
and uses a recursively refined Cartesian grid to solve Poisson's equation for
the potential, rather than obtaining the potential from a Green's function.
Refinements can have arbitrary shapes and in practice closely follow the
complex morphology of the density field that evolves. The timestep shortens by
a factor two with each successive refinement. It is argued that an appropriate
choice of softening length is of great importance and that the softening should
be at all points an appropriate multiple of the local inter-particle
separation. Unlike tree and P3M codes, multigrid codes automatically satisfy
this requirement. We show that at early times and low densities in cosmological
simulations, the softening needs to be significantly smaller relative to the
inter-particle separation than in virialized regions. Tests of the ability of
the code's Poisson solver to recover the gravitational fields of both
virialized halos and Zel'dovich waves are presented, as are tests of the code's
ability to reproduce analytic solutions for plane-wave evolution. The times
required to conduct a LCDM cosmological simulation for various configurations

out in 1996, 1998 and 1999 with simultaneous B, V photometry. A multicomponent
spectrum is revealed with a veiled photospheric spectrum, broad emissions,
narrow emission lines of helium, and accretion, wind and shell features.
  Periodic modulations in many spectral features were found. The photospheric
absorption lines show sinusoidal variations in radial velocity with an
amplitude of +-6 km/s and a period of about 2.77 days. The radial velocities of
the narrow emission lines of He vary with the same period but in anti-phase to
the photospheric lines. The equivalent widths of the narrow emissions vary with
a phase-shift with respect to the velocity curve. The strength of the
red-shifted accretion components of Na D and other lines is also modulated with
the same period. The broad emission lines of metals vary mostly with the double
period of about 5.5 days.
  One unexpected result is that no correlation was found between the veiling
and the brightness, although both varied in wide ranges. This is partly due to
a contribution of the shell absorption to the photospheric line profiles, which
make them vary in width and depth thus simulating lower veiling.
  Most of the observed features can be interpreted in the framework of
non-axisymmetric magnetospheric accretion. We consider two possible models. In
the first the asymmetry is induced by orbital motion of an invisible, low mass
secondary, which also influences the gasflows around the star, the second
considers rotational modulation of a single star with an inclined or asymmetric
magnetosphere.","(Abridged) High-resolution spectroscopic monitoring of RW Aur A was carried

properties of a statistically complete core-selected sample of compact
radio-loud active galactic nuclei, based on data from the VLBI Space Observing
Programme (Paper I) and previously published studies. Our sample is drawn from
the well-studied Pearson-Readhead (PR) survey, and is ideally suited for
investigating the general effects of relativistic beaming in compact radio
sources. In addition to confirming many previously known correlations, we have
discovered several new trends that lend additional support to the beaming
model. These trends suggest that the most highly beamed sources in
core-selected samples tend to have a) high optical polarizations; b) large
pc/kpc-scale jet misalignments; c) prominent VLBI core components; d)
one-sided, core, or halo radio morphology on kiloparsec scales; e) narrow
emission line equivalent widths; and f) a strong tendency for intraday
variability at radio wavelengths. We have used higher resolution space and
ground-based VLBI maps to confirm the bi-modality of the jet misalignment
distribution for the PR survey, and find that the sources with aligned parsec-
and kiloparsec-scale jets generally have arcsecond-scale radio emission on both
sides of the core. The aligned sources also have broader emission line widths.
We find evidence that the BL Lacertae objects in the PR survey are all highly
beamed, and have very similar properties to the high-optically polarized
quasars, with the exception of smaller redshifts. A cluster analysis on our
data shows that after partialing out the effects of redshift, the luminosities
of our sample objects in various wave bands are generally well-correlated with

been known to provide a natural explanation for the origin of stellar
exponential discs, under the assumption that the star formation and viscous
timescales are comparable. We present models which invoke simultaneous star
formation, viscous redistribution of gas and cosmologically-motivated gaseous
infall and explore the predictions such models make for the scale length
evolution and radial star formation history of galactic stellar discs. While
the inclusion of viscous flows is essential for ensuring that the stellar disc
is always exponential over a significant range in radius, we find that such
flows play essentially no role in determining the evolution of the disc scale
length. In models in which the main infall phase precedes the onset of star
formation and viscous evolution, we find the exponential scale length to be
rather invariant with time. On the other hand, models in which star
formation/viscous evolution and infall occur concurrently result in a smoothly
increasing scale length with time, reflecting the mean angular momentum of
material which has fallen in at any given epoch. The disc stellar populations
in these models are predominantly young (ie. ages < 5 Gyr) beyond a few scale
lengths. In both cases, viscous flows are entirely responsible for transporting
material to very large radii. We discuss existing observational constraints on
these models from studies of both local and moderate redshift disc galaxies. In
particular, a good agreement is found between the solar neighbourhood star
formation history predicted by our infall model and the recent observational
determination of this quantity by Rocha-Pinto et al (2000).","Models of disc galaxies which invoke viscosity-driven radial flows have long

diagonal and off-diagonal modes, which are very flexible to deal with
configuration-related problems in the power spectrum detection. With simulation
samples and mock catalogues of the Las Campanas redshift survey (LCRS), we show
(1) the slice-like geometry of the LCRS doesn't affect the off-diagonal power
spectrum with ``slice-like'' mode; (2) the Poisson sampling with the LCRS
selection function doesn't cause more than 1-$\sigma$ error in the DWT power
spectrum; and (3) the powers of peculiar velocity fluctuations, which cause the
redshift distortion, are approximately scale-independent. These results insure
that the uncertainties of the power spectrum measurement are under control. The
