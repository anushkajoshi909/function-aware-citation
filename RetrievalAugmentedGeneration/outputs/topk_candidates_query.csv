0,astro-ph/0103463,Can A Gravitational Quadruple Lens Produce 17 images?,2001,Sun Hong Rhie,"Gravitational lensing can be by a faint star, a trillion stars of a galaxy,
or a cluster of galaxies, and this poses a familiar struggle between particle
method and mean field method. In a bottom-up approach, a puzzle has been laid
on whether a quadruple lens can produce 17 images. The number of images is
governed by the gravitational lens equation, and the equation for $n$-tuple
lenses suggests that the maximum number of images of a point source potentially
increases as $n^2+1$. Indeed, the classes of $n=1, 2, 3$ lenses produce up to
$n^2+1 = 2, 5, 10$ images. We discuss the $n$-point lens system as a
two-dimensional harmonic flow of an inviscid fluid, count the caustics
topologically, recognize the significance of the limit points and discuss the
notion of image domains. We conjecture that the total number of positive images
is bounded by the number of finite limit points $2(n-1): n>1$ (1 limit point at
$\infty$ if $n=1$). A corollary is that the total number of images of a point
source produced by an $n$-tuple lens can not exceed $5(n-1):n>1$. We construct
quadruple lenses with distinct finite limit points that can produce up to 15
images and argue why there can not be more than 15 images. We show that the
maximum number of images is bounded from below by $3(n+1): n \ge 3$. We also
comment on ""thick Einstein rings"" that can have one or more holes.",1.0,0.8745471239089966,"gravitational, images","gravitational, images, lenses, lensing, maximum, number, produced, tuple","potential, areas, future, research, motivated, limitations, current, gravitational, lensing, predicting, maximum, number, images, produced, tuple, lenses","Motivation, FutureWork",,2025-09-20T19:50:49.056867

sight. The probability for strong gravitational lensing by more than one lens
is small, but a number of strong lens systems in which more than one separate
lens contribute significantly to the lensing potential will be detected in the
large sample of lens systems compiled with new instruments. Using multi-lens
ray-tracing, we estimate the likelihood for gravitational lensing by two lenses
at different redshifts and investigate typical image geometries and
magnification cross sections. We find that, for a cosmology with Omega_M=0.3
and Omega_Lambda=0.7, about one in twenty lens systems consist of two lenses
with merging caustics. Multiple lens systems differ from single lenses. They
have a larger multiple imaging cross section and significantly differ in the
image configuration. The external shear induced by a nearby galaxy, group or
cluster can affect image positions even for more widely separated lens pairs.
Both of these effects must be accounted for in lens modelling. We also show how
the presence of aligned discs in the pair of lensing galaxies can lead to very
large high-magnification cross sections. Multiple lens systems will be

faint elliptical galaxies using the WFPC2 on HST and here we investigate their
potential usefulness in putting constraints on lens mass models. We compare
various ellipsoidal surface mass distributions, including those with and
without a core radius, as well as models in which the mass distributions are
assumed to have the same axis ratio and orientation as the galaxy light. We
also study models which use a spherical mass distribution having various
profiles, both empirical and following those predicted by CDM simulations.
These models also include a gravitational shear term. The model parameters and
associated errors have been derived by 2-dimensional analysis of the observed
HST WFPC2 images. The maximum likelihood procedure iteratively converges
simultaneously on the model for the lensing elliptical galaxy and the lensed
image components. The motivation for this study was to distinguish between
these mass models with this technique. However, we find that, despite using the
full image data rather than just locations and integrated magnitudes, the
lenses are fit equally well with several of the mass models. Each of the mass
models generates a similar configuration but with a different magnification and
cross-sectional area within the caustic, and both of these latter quantities
govern the discovery probability of lensing in the survey. These differences
contribute to considerable cosmic scatter in any estimate of the cosmological
constant using gravitational lenses.",0.4972432255744934,0.8502414226531982,gravitational,"gravitational, images, lenses, lensing, maximum, potential","potential, areas, future, research, motivated, limitations, current, gravitational, lensing, predicting, maximum, number, images, produced, tuple, lenses","Motivation, FutureWork",,2025-09-20T19:50:49.056867

due to thermal motion of WDM particles. This may provide a natural resolution
to some puzzles in standard cold dark matter (CDM) theory such as the cusped
density profiles of virialized dark halos and the overabundance of low mass
satellites. One of the observational tests of the WDM model is to measure the
gravitationally lensed images of distant quasars below sub-arcsecond scales. In
this Letter, we report a comparison of the lensing probabilities of multiple
images between CDM and WDM models using a singular isothermal sphere model for
the mass density profiles of dark halos and the Press-Schechter mass function
for their distribution and cosmic evolution. It is shown that the differential
probability of multiple images with small angular separations down to 10
milliarcseconds should allow one to set useful constraints on the WDM particle
mass. We discuss briefly the feasibility and uncertainties of this method in

7,astro-ph/0101228,Using Gravitational Lensing to study HI clouds at high redshift,2001,Tarun Deep SainiSomnath BharadwajShiv Kumar Sethi,"We investigate the possibility of detecting HI emission from gravitationally
lensed HI clouds (akin to damped Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds) at high redshift by
carrying out deep radio observations in the fields of known cluster lenses.
Such observations will be possible with present radio telescopes only if the
lens substantially magnifies the flux of the HI emission. While at present this
holds the only possibility of detecting the HI emission from such clouds, it
has the disadvantage of being restricted to clouds that lie very close to the
caustics of the lens. We find that observations at a detection threshold of 50
micro Jy at 320 MHz (possible with the GMRT) have a greater than 20%
probability of detecting an HI cloud in the field of a cluster, provided the
clouds have HI masses in the range 5 X 10^8 M_{\odot} < M_{HI} < 2.5 X 10^{10}
M_{\odot}. The probability of detecting a cloud increases if they have larger
HI masses, except in the cases where the number of HI clouds in the cluster
field becomes very small. The probability of a detection at 610 MHz and 233 MHz
is comparable to that at 320 MHz, though a definitive statement is difficult
owing to uncertainties in the HI content at the redshifts corresponding to
these frequencies. Observations at a detection threshold of 2 micro Jy
(possible in the future with the SKA) are expected to detect a few HI clouds in
the field of every cluster provided the clouds have HI masses in the range 2 X
10^7 M_{\odot} < M_{HI} < 10^9 M_{\odot}. Even if such observations do not
result in the detection of HI clouds, they will be able to put useful
constraints on the HI content of the clouds.",0.3637392520904541,0.8437871932983398,"gravitational, lensing","future, lenses, number","potential, areas, future, research, motivated, limitations, current, gravitational, lensing, predicting, maximum, number, images, produced, tuple, lenses","Motivation, FutureWork",,2025-09-20T19:50:49.056867
8,astro-ph/0103500,Constraining the Cosmological Parameters using Strong Lensing,2001,G. GolseJ. -P. KneibG. Soucail,"We investigate the potentiality of using strong lensing clusters to constrain
the cosmological parameters Omega_m and Omega_lambda. The existence of a
multiple image system with known redshift allows, for a given (Omega_m,
Omega_lambda) cosmology, absolute calibration of the total mass deduced from
lens modelling. Recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of galaxy
clusters reveal a large number of multiple images, which are predicted to be at
different redshifts. If it is possible to measure spectroscopically the
redshifts of many multiple images then one can in principle constrain
(Omega_m,Omega_lambda) through ratios of angular diameter distances,
independently of any external assumptions. For a regular/relaxed cluster
observed by HST with 3 multiple image systems, each with different
spectroscopic redshifts, we show by analytic calculation that the following
uncertainties can be expected: Omega_m=0.30 +/- 0.11, Omega_lambda=0.70 +/-
0.23 or Omega_m=1.00 +/- 0.17, Omega_lambda=0.00 +/- 0.48 for the two most
popular world models. Numerical tests on simulated data confirm these good
constraints, even in the case of more realistic cluster potentials, such as
bimodal clusters, or when including perturbations by galaxies. To investigate
the sensitivity of the method to different mass profiles, we also use an
analytic ``pseudo-elliptical'' Navarro, Frenk & White profile in the
simulations. These constraints can be improved if more than 3 multiple images
with spectroscopic redshifts are observed, or by combining the results from
different clusters. Some prospects on the determination of the cosmological
parameters with gravitational lensing are given.",0.3269062042236328,0.842006504535675,lensing,"gravitational, images, lensing, number","potential, areas, future, research, motivated, limitations, current, gravitational, lensing, predicting, maximum, number, images, produced, tuple, lenses","Motivation, FutureWork",,2025-09-20T19:50:49.056867

large (7''-30'') image separations, which probe masses on the scale of galaxy
clusters. We have carried out a survey for gravitationally-lensed objects,
among sources in the FIRST 20cm radio survey that have unresolved optical
counterparts in the digitizations of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. From
the statistics of ongoing surveys that search for quasars among FIRST sources,
we estimate that there are about 9100 quasars in this source sample, making
this one of the largest lensing surveys to date. Using broad-band imaging, we
have isolated all objects with double radio components separated by 5''-30'',
that have unresolved optical counterparts with similar BVI colours. Our
criteria for similar colours conservatively allow for observational error and
for colour variations due to time delays between lensed images. Spectroscopy of
these candidates shows that none of the pairs are lensed quasars. This sets an
upper limit (95% confidence) on the lensing fraction in this survey of
3.3x10^-4, assuming 9100 quasars. Although the source redshift distribution is
poorly known, a rough calculation of the expected lensing frequency and the
detection efficiencies and biases suggests that simple theoretical expectations
are of the same order of magnitude as our observational upper limit. Our
procedure is novel in that our exhaustive search for lensed objects does not
require prior identification of the quasars in the sample as such.

result to constrain quantitatively the mass properties of clusters.",0.2838827073574066,0.839926540851593,,"images, lensing","potential, areas, future, research, motivated, limitations, current, gravitational, lensing, predicting, maximum, number, images, produced, tuple, lenses","Motivation, FutureWork",,2025-09-20T19:50:49.056867

Supernova/Acceleration Probe [SNAP]) has been proposed dedicated to observing
thousands of supernovae per year out to a redshift of 1.7. Although it is
exceedingly unlikely that we will see a multiply-imaged supernova from ongoing

Since having a standard candle is inessential to most lensing studies, SNAP's
large sample of type II supernovae contributes to this rate. Each case of
strong lensing allows for a precise determination of time delays, image
separations, and relative image magnifications, and the SNAP strong-lensing

both weak and strong lensing, using very recent solutions of the Dyer-Roeder

distribution of dark matter halos. We address in particular the effect of a

finite sizes of lensed sources.
  We show that, if dark matter fluctuations are normalized to the local cluster
abundance, in the presence of a cosmological constant the optical depth for
lensing {\em decreases} compared to the case of an Einstein-de Sitter universe,
because halos in the relevant mass range are less abundant over a large
redshift interval. We also discuss the differences in the magnification
probability distributions produced by Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) and by
Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) density profiles of lenses. We find that the
NFW lens is more efficient for moderate magnifications ($2\lsim A\lsim 4$), and
less efficient for larger magnifications. Moreover, we discuss quantitatively
the maximum magnification, $A_{\rm max}$, that can be achieved in the case of
extended sources (galaxies) with realistic luminosity profiles, taking into
account the possible ellipticity of the lens potential. Finally, we apply our

isotemperature statistics in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky, which
is induced by the gravitational lensing due to the intervening large-scale
structure of the universe. To develop the method, we focus on a specific
statistical property of the intrinsic Gaussian CMB field; a field point in the
map that has a larger absolute value of the temperature threshold tends to have
a larger absolute value of the curvature parameter defined by a trace of second
derivative matrix of the temperature field, while the ellipticity parameter
similarly defined is uniformly distributed independently of the threshold
because of the isotropic nature of the Gaussian field. The weak lensing then
causes a stronger distortion effect on the isotemperature contours with higher
threshold and especially induces a coherent distribution of the ellipticity
parameter correlated with the threshold as a result of the coupling between the
CMB curvature parameter and the gravitational tidal shear in the observed map.
These characteristic patterns can be statistically picked up by considering
three independent characteristic functions, which are obtained from the
averages of quadratic combinations of the second derivative fields of CMB over
isotemperature contours with each threshold. Consequently, we find that the
lensing effect generates non-Gaussian signatures on those functions that have a
distinct functional dependence of the threshold. We test the method using
numerical simulations of CMB maps and show that the lensing signals can be
measured definitely, provided that we use CMB data with sufficiently low noise
and high angular resolution.",0.18238991498947144,0.8350198864936829,lensing,"gravitational, lensing","potential, areas, future, research, motivated, limitations, current, gravitational, lensing, predicting, maximum, number, images, produced, tuple, lenses","Motivation, FutureWork",,2025-09-20T19:50:49.056867

group during 1997--1999 is analyzed. The significant light amplifications in
the C and A quasar components with maxima in mid- and late 1999, respectively,
are interpreted as the crossing of microlens caustics by the source. A
constraint on the emitting-region size R < 10^(15) cm has been obtained from
the light-curve shape by assuming a power-law quasar brightness distribution
(r^2+R^2)^(-p). To estimate the exponent p ~ 1.2 requires refining the standard
model for the quasar continuum formation in an optically thick accretion disk
with p = 1.5",0.17285215854644775,0.8345587849617004,gravitational,gravitational,"potential, areas, future, research, motivated, limitations, current, gravitational, lensing, predicting, maximum, number, images, produced, tuple, lenses","Motivation, FutureWork",,2025-09-20T19:50:49.056867
