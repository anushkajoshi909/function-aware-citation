pulsar (PSR B0833-45) made with a baseband recording system at observing
frequencies of 660 and 1413 MHz. We have discovered two startling features in
the 1413 MHz single pulse data. The first is the presence of giant micro-pulses
which are confined to the leading edge of the pulse profile. One of these
pulses has a peak flux density in excess of 2500 Jy, more than 40 times the
integrated pulse peak. The second new result is the presence of a large
amplitude gaussian component on the trailing edge of the pulse profile. This
component can exceed the main pulse in intensity but is switched on only
relatively rarely. Fluctutation spectra reveal a possible periodicity in this
feature of 140 pulse periods. Unlike the rest of the profile, this component
has low net polarization and emits predominantly in the orthogonal mode. This
feature appears to be unique to the Vela pulsar. We have also detected
microstructure in the Vela pulsar for the first time. These same features are
present in the 660 MHz data. We suggest that the full width of the Vela pulse
profile might be as large as 10 ms but that the conal edges emit only rarely.","We present high time resolution observations of single pulses from the Vela

and radiation in the magnetospheres of energetic pulsars. The six or more
pulsars seen by CGRO/EGRET show that: the light curves usually have double-peak
structures (suggesting a broad cone of emission); gamma rays are frequently the
dominant component of the radiated power; and all the spectra show evidence of
a high-energy turnover. Unless a new pulsed component appears at higher
energies, progress in gamma-ray pulsar studies will be greatest in the 1-20 GeV
range. Ground-based telescopes whose energy ranges extend downward toward 10
GeV should make important measurements of the spectral cutoffs. The Gamma-ray
Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), now in planning for a launch in 2005, will
provide a major advance in sensitivity, energy range, and sky coverage.","High-energy gamma rays are a valuable tool for studying particle acceleration

  identification and spectroscopy of selected candidates","A new sample of very large angular size radio sources has been selected from
the 1.4 GHz VLA surveys: FIRST and NVSS. This sample will be very useful for an
observational constraint on the time evolution of double radio sources,
especially their size, predicted by numerous analytical models of such
evolution (cf. Introduction). In this paper we present radio and optical data
for a large fraction of the sample sources. They are: high-frequency VLA maps
with very weak radio cores detected, deep optical images showing the identified
faint host galaxies not visible on the DSS images, and optical spectra of the
identified galaxies brighter than about R ~ 18.5 mag taken with the McDonald
Observatory 2.1m telescope. For 15 galaxies (of which 4 do not belong to the
complete sample) the redshift has been determined. In the result, 44 per cent
of galaxies in the complete sample have redshift data (with one exception all
redshifts are less than 0.33), of which 70 per cent have a linear size
exceeding 1 Mpc. The photometric redshift estimates for other 11 galaxies with
19 mag<R<21.7 mag (0.3<z<0.5) predict their sizes much over 1 Mpc.","A new sample of very large angular size radio sources has been selected from

intermediate Galactic latitudes at 1400 MHz with the Parkes radio telescope.
Eight of these pulsars possess small pulse periods and period derivatives
thought to be indicative of ``recycling''. Six of the pulsars are in circular
binary systems, including two with relatively massive white dwarf companions.
We discuss the implications of these new systems for theories of binary
formation and evolution. One long-period pulsar (J1410-7404) has a moderately
weak magnetic field and an exceedingly narrow average pulse profile, similar to
other recycled pulsars.","We present the timing parameters of nine pulsars discovered in a survey of

4,0.8305156230926514,astro-ph/0104476,"Detection of Pulsed X-ray Emission from The Fastest Millisecond Pulsar
  PSR B1937+21 with ASCA","We have detected pulsed X-ray emission from the fastest millisecond pulsar
known, PSR B1937+21 (P=1.558 msec), with ASCA. The pulsar is detected as a
point source above $\sim 1.7$ keV, with no indication of nebulosity. The source
flux in the 2--10 keV band is found to be $f = (3.7\pm 0.6) \times 10^{-13}$
erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, which implies an isotropic luminosity of $L_{\rm x} = 4
\pi D^2 f \sim (5.7\pm 1.0) \times 10^{32} ~(D/3.6 {\rm kpc})^2$ erg s$^{-1}$,
where D is the distance, and an X-ray efficiency of $\sim 5 \times 10^{-4}$
relative to the spin-down power of the pulsar.
  The pulsation is found at the period predicted by the radio ephemeris with a
very narrow primary peak, the width of which is about 1/16 phase ($\sim 100
\mu$s), near the time resolution limit ($61 \mu$s) of the observation. The
instantaneous flux in the primary peak (1/16 phase interval) is found to be
($4.0\pm 0.8) \times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Although there is an
indication for the secondary peak, we consider its statistical significance too
low to claim a definite detection.
  The narrow pulse profile and the detection in the 2--10 keV band imply that
the X-ray emission is caused by the magnetospheric particle acceleration.
Comparison of X-ray and radio arrival times of pulses indicates, within the
timing errors, that the X-ray pulse is coincident with the radio interpulse.","We have detected pulsed X-ray emission from the fastest millisecond pulsar

  the JAERI-KEK High Intensity Proton Accelerator","In this paper, we discuss physics potential of the Very Long Base-Line (VLBL)
Neutrino-Oscillation Experiments with the High Intensity Proton Accelerator
(HIPA), which is planned to be built by 2006 in Tokaimura, Japan.
  We propose to use conventional narrow-band \nu_\mu beams (NBB) from HIPA for
observing the \nu_\mu \to \nu_e transition probability and the \nu_\mu survival
probability.
  The pulsed NBB allows us to obtain useful information through counting
experiments at a huge water-Cherenkov detector which may be placed in our
neighbor countries.
  We study sensitivity of such an experiment to the neutrino mass hierarchy,
the mass-squared differences, the mixing angles and the CP phase of the 3\times
3 lepton flavor mixing matrix (MNS matrix).
  The CP phase can be measured with a 100kt detector if both the mass-squared
difference and U_{e3} elements of the MNS matrix are sufficiently large.","In this paper, we discuss physics potential of the Very Long Base-Line (VLBL)

supermassive object collapses are far more energetic than solar mass-scale
compact mergers. Also, in their proposal the seeds of supermassive black holes

occur a strong generation of gravitational waves (GWs) during the formation of
SMBHs. As a result, the rate of such GW bursts could be as high as the rate of
GRBs in the model by Fuller & Shi. In this case, the detection of GRBs and
bursts of GWs should occur with a small time difference. We also argue that the
GWs produced by the SMBHs studied here could be detected when the Laser
