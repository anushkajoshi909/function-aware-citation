3,astro-ph/0103048,Polarization Insights for Active Galactic Nuclei,2001,R. R. J. Antonucci,"Optical spectropolarimetry and broadband polarimetry in other wavebands has
been a key to understanding many diverse aspects of AGN. In some cases
polarization is due to synchrotron radiation, and in other cases it's due to
scattering. Recognition of relativistically beamed optical synchrotron emission
by polarization was vital for understanding blazars (BL Lacs and Optically
Violently Variable quasars), both physically and geometrically. Radio
polarimetry of quiescent AGN is equally important, again for both purposes.
Scattering polarization was central to the Unified Model for Seyferts, Radio
Galaxies and (high ionization) Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies. It provides a
periscope for viewing AGN from other directions. Finally, if we could
understand its message, polarization would also provide major insights
regarding the nature of the AGN ""Featureless Continuum"" and Broad (emission)
Line Region. I point out that high ionization ULIRGs have all the exact right
properties to be called Quasar 2s. Mid-IR observations generally don't
penetrate to the nucleus, greatly reducing their ability to diagnose the energy

provide smoking-gun signals for new-physics contributions to different isospin

the asymptotic behavior and the zeros of the decay amplitude. In the inelastic
region the phase of the decay amplitude cannot be determined by strong
interaction alone and even its asymptotic value cannot be deduced from
experiment. More a fundamental issue is intrinsic nonuniqueness of off-shell

complexity of intermediate-energy meson interactions, we attempt to obtain a

11,hep-ph/0104234,A proposal on the possibility of detecting D-particles,2001,Elias GravanisNick E. Mavromatos,"In a previous study we showed that D0-branes (particles) can operate as
sources of very-high-energy radiation, as a result of an unstable spacetime
distortion that follows a D0-particle/closed string state scattering. The
effect can happen only if the energy of the incident particle/closed string
state exceeds a certain threshold, which is of order of the subsequently
radiated energy. In this letter we speculate on the possibility of detection of
the D-particles due to this phenomenon. The energies of the emitted radiation
range in a narrow window of size less than one order of magnitude.
Observation-wise, this radiation will appear as an excess of photons in a
narrow band in the spectrum of high energy cosmic rays. From their energy we
can then read off the value of the product of the string mass scale times the
string coupling. We speculate on the possibility that high energy neutrinos
from GRB's play the r\^ole of the necessary high energy flux that triggers the
effect, by striking D-particles lying inside the mean free path of the photons
as measured from Earth. The possibilty of this effect operating as a mechanism
of GZK cutoff violation is also pointed out.",0.14193809032440186,0.8604244589805603,,"high, observation","observation, anti, flow, signal, neutral, strange, mesons, motivate, extend, understanding, medium, kaon, vector, potential, high, density, nuclear, matter","Motivation, Extends",,2025-09-19T10:44:30.754803
12,hep-ph/0104001,The strange border of the QCD phases,2001,Sonja Kabana,"We address the flavour composition along the border between the hadronic and
the quark-gluon plasma phases of QCD. The ratio of strange to up and down
antiquarks ($\lambda_s$) produced in partic le and nuclear collisions, is found
to increase in collisions with initially reached energy density ($\epsilon_i$)
up to $\epsilon_{crit}$ $\sim$ 1 GeV/$fm^3$. Above this value it decreases
approximately linearly and reaches its asymptotic value at zero baryon chemical
potential ($\mu_B$). We demonstrate that $\lambda_s$ in nuclear collisions is
approaching its asymptotic value at $\epsilon_i$ $\sim$ 8-9 GeV/$fm^3$,
corresponding to $\sqrt{s}$ $\sim$ 3-8 TeV per nucleon+nucleon pair which will
be reached at the LHC. After correcting for the difference in the chemical
potentials of various colliding systems, $\lambda_s$ universally saturates
across the QCD phase boundary, following the temperature. Recent experimental
puzzles as the increase in the $K/\pi$ ratio in Pb+Pb collisions at 40 GeV per
nucleon, its different behaviour at midrapidity, the decrease of the double
ratio of $K/\pi$(A+A/p+p) in nucleus nucleus over p+p collisions with
increasing $\sqrt{s}$, and the increase of $\lambda_s$ in p+A over p+p
collisions at the same $\sqrt{s}$, are naturally explained. We study the
approach of thermodynamic observables at $\mu_B=0$ to the transition point and

spacings were tuned using the static quark potential, so as a byproduct we
obtain updated results for the effect of sea quarks on the static quark
potential. We find indications that the full QCD meson spectrum is in better

effects ($<k_T>$ = $1-1.5 GeV/c$, as yet unaccounted for by hard QCD), found by
the Fermilab E706 Collaboration for 530 and 800 GeV/c protons incident on light
nuclear targets (mass $A$) like Be. The essential idea is that such high
incident projectile momenta tend to break up the confinement barriers for the
quark-partons residing in the individual nucleonic constituents of the target
nucleus that fall in a tube-like zone around the projectile's path, so that
these particles tend to behave as a collection of quark-partons confronting the
beam. Using simple combinatorial principles, the resultant $<k_T>^2$ value
works out as $(3A_{eff}-1) \beta^2$, where $A_{eff}$ is the number of affected
nucleons in the tube-like zone, and $\beta$ is a scale parameter derived from
the basic quark-pair interaction. Using the previously found results of a
Bethe-Salpeter model (attuned to $q{\bar q}$ and $qqq$ spectroscopy), one in
which a key ingredient is the infrared part of the gluon propagator, giving
$\beta^2= 0.068 GeV^2$, the desired $<k_T>$ range is reproduced, suggesting the
