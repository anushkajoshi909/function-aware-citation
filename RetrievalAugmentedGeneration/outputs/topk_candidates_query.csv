pulsar (PSR B0833-45) made with a baseband recording system at observing
frequencies of 660 and 1413 MHz. We have discovered two startling features in
the 1413 MHz single pulse data. The first is the presence of giant micro-pulses
which are confined to the leading edge of the pulse profile. One of these
pulses has a peak flux density in excess of 2500 Jy, more than 40 times the
integrated pulse peak. The second new result is the presence of a large
amplitude gaussian component on the trailing edge of the pulse profile. This
component can exceed the main pulse in intensity but is switched on only
relatively rarely. Fluctutation spectra reveal a possible periodicity in this
feature of 140 pulse periods. Unlike the rest of the profile, this component
has low net polarization and emits predominantly in the orthogonal mode. This
feature appears to be unique to the Vela pulsar. We have also detected
microstructure in the Vela pulsar for the first time. These same features are
present in the 660 MHz data. We suggest that the full width of the Vela pulse
profile might be as large as 10 ms but that the conal edges emit only rarely.",1.0,0.8901641964912415,"pulsar, vela","amplitude, component, gaussian, giant, large, micro, profile, pulsar, pulse, pulses, vela","future, research, directions, motivated, discovery, giant, micro, pulses, large, amplitude, gaussian, component, vela, pulsar, pulse, profile","Motivation, FutureWork",,2025-09-21T23:17:20.552395

  PSR B1937+21 with ASCA",2001,M. Takahashi,"We have detected pulsed X-ray emission from the fastest millisecond pulsar
known, PSR B1937+21 (P=1.558 msec), with ASCA. The pulsar is detected as a
point source above $\sim 1.7$ keV, with no indication of nebulosity. The source
flux in the 2--10 keV band is found to be $f = (3.7\pm 0.6) \times 10^{-13}$

where D is the distance, and an X-ray efficiency of $\sim 5 \times 10^{-4}$
relative to the spin-down power of the pulsar.
  The pulsation is found at the period predicted by the radio ephemeris with a
very narrow primary peak, the width of which is about 1/16 phase ($\sim 100

instantaneous flux in the primary peak (1/16 phase interval) is found to be
($4.0\pm 0.8) \times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Although there is an
indication for the secondary peak, we consider its statistical significance too
low to claim a definite detection.
  The narrow pulse profile and the detection in the 2--10 keV band imply that
the X-ray emission is caused by the magnetospheric particle acceleration.

Vela pulsar with the Chandra X-ray observatory. The spectrum of the pulsar does
not show statistically significant spectral lines in the observed 0.25-8.0 keV

spectrum consists of two distinct components. The softer component can be
modeled as a magnetic hydrogen atmosphere spectrum - for the pulsar magnetic
field $B=3\times 10^{12}$ G and neutron star mass $M=1.4 M_\odot$ and radius
$R^\infty =13$ km, we obtain $\tef^\infty =0.68\pm 0.03$ MK, $L_{\rm

effective temperature, bolometric luminosity, and radius are as measured by a

temperature corresponds to a radius, $R^\infty =(2.1\pm 0.2) d_{250}$ km, much

study stellar astrophysics, especially stellar atmospheres, stellar masses, and
binarity. I review this progress. Stellar atmospheres can be probed whenever
the source in a microlensing event passes over the caustic (contour of infinite
magnification) induced by the lens because the caustic effectively resolves the
source. Broad-band observations of four events have yielded limb-darkening
measurements, which in essence map the atmospheric temperature as a function of
depth. And now, for the first time, spectroscopic observations of one event
promise much richer diagnostics of the source atmosphere. In the past two
years, a practical method has finally been developed to systematically measure
the lens masses in microlensing events. This will permit a census of all
massive objects, both dark and luminous, in the Galactic bulge, including
low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The
method combines traditional ground-based photometry with astrometric and
photometric measurements by the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) in solar
orbit. Using a related technique SIM can also obtain accurate (>~ 1%) mass
measurement of a dozen or so nearby stars, thus enabling precision tests of
stellar models. Binary lenses can give rise to dramatic and easily detectable
microlensing signatures, even for large mass ratios. This makes microlensing a
potentially powerful probe of the companion mass distribution, especially in
the Galactic bulge where this function is difficult to probe by other
techniques.",0.11300358176231384,0.8260776400566101,,large,"future, research, directions, motivated, discovery, giant, micro, pulses, large, amplitude, gaussian, component, vela, pulsar, pulse, profile","Motivation, FutureWork",,2025-09-21T23:17:20.552395

typical burst's frequency is Doppler shifted, with the blue-shift factor being
strongly beamed in the forward direction. As a consequence, the energy flux
carried by the gravitational radiation is beamed. In the second part of the
