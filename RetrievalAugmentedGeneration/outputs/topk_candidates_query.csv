a fluid of inelastic hard spheres (IHS), exhibits two instabilities: the
spontaneous formation of vortices and of high density clusters. We suppress the
clustering instability by imposing constraints on the system sizes, in order to
illustrate how LG-equations can be derived for the order parameter, being the
rate of deformation or shear rate tensor, which controls the formation of

complexity, in particular unifying ideas from the physics literature with ideas
from learning and coding theory; there are even connections of this statistical
approach to algorithmic or Kolmogorov complexity. Moreover, a set of simple

the KIP imposes the form of the generalized entropy associated to the system

the generalized entropy. Thirdly, the KIP allows, on one hand, to treat all the
classical or quantum statistical distributions already known in the literature
in a unifying scheme and, on the other hand, suggests how we can introduce
naturally new distributions. Finally, as a working example of the approach to
the non linear kinetics here presented, a new non extensive statistics is

Those directions are the tangent one to a Hamiltonian flow and the gradient one
of the Hamiltonian function. To separate out these two directions and to apply
Lyapunov analysis effectively in directions for which Lyapunov exponents are
not trivial, a geometric method is proposed for natural Hamiltonian systems, in
particular. In this geometric method, Hamiltonian flows of a natural
Hamiltonian system are regarded as geodesic flows on the cotangent bundle of a
Riemannian manifold with a suitable metric. Stability/instability of the
geodesic flows is then analyzed by linearized equations of motion which are
related to the Jacobi equations on the Riemannian manifold. On some geometric
setting on the cotangent bundle, it is shown that along a geodesic flow in
question, there exist Lyapunov vectors such that two of them are in the two
marginal directions and the others orthogonal to the marginal directions. It is
also pointed out that Lyapunov vectors with such properties can not be obtained
in general by the usual method which uses linearized Hamilton's equations of
