The hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach extends previous methods by allowing for high-accuracy calculations of PNC s-d amplitudes, which are about four times larger than corresponding s-s transitions, and can compete with the accuracy of Cs 6s-7s calculations if certain E1 amplitudes are measured to high accuracy. This approach is compared to the sum-over-states approach for the Cs 6s-7s transition, where strong cancelations between terms occur, in contrast to the dominant term in the s-d transitions (Ginges 2001) [physics/0101044] [Compares]
The hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach extends previous methods by allowing for high-accuracy calculations of PNC s-d amplitudes, competing with the accuracy of Cs 6s-7s calculations if p_{1/2}-d_{3/2} E1 amplitudes are measured to high accuracy. This approach improves upon prior work by reducing cancelations between terms and identifying a dominating term that can be calculated to better than 1% accuracy (Ginges 2001) [physics/0101044] [Extends]
