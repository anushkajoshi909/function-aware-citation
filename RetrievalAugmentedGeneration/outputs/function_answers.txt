The study of NGC 3065 is motivated by its unique X-ray properties, which led to the discovery of its LINER classification with broad, variable Balmer lines, a phenomenon that is not well understood. Understanding this galaxy's properties is important because it can provide insights into the behavior of active galactic nuclei, particularly those with low accretion rates (astro-ph/0101050).

The study of NGC 3065 is motivated by its X-ray properties, and understanding its classification as a LINER with broad, variable Balmer lines requires background knowledge of active galactic nuclei and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (astro-ph/0101050). [Background]
