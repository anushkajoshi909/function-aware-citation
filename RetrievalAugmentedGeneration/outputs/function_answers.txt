The limitations of current gravitational lensing methods in predicting the maximum number of images produced by n-tuple lenses motivate further research into the topological properties of n-point lens systems and the bounds of image production. This is important because understanding these limits can reveal new insights into the behavior of complex gravitational lensing systems (astro-ph/0103463). [Motivation]
Future research may investigate improving lens modeling to account for effects such as external shear and aligned discs in multiple lens systems. Statistical lensing studies and constraining lens models of individual systems are also potential areas of future research (astro-ph/0103093). [FutureWork]
