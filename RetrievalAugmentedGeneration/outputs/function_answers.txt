The bias introduced by fixed apertures in determining the color-magnitude relation of early type galaxies motivates this study because it affects the accuracy of the relation, and understanding this bias is crucial for refining our knowledge of galaxy evolution. This work extends previous studies by accounting for internal radial color gradients, which are found to significantly impact the color-magnitude relation (astro-ph/0102090). [Motivation]
This study extends previous work on the color-magnitude relation of early-type galaxies by accounting for the bias introduced by fixed apertures, increasing the accuracy of the relation by using homogeneous color measurements within the galaxy's effective radius. The new approach yields a significantly flatter color-magnitude relation, improving upon the traditional fixed-aperture method (astro-ph/0102090). [Extends]
