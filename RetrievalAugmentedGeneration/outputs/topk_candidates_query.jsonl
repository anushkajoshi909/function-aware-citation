The two\nmain routes leading to this scenario: binary neutron star mergers and Collapsar\n- the collapse of a rotating star to a black hole, are classical sources for\ngravitational radiation. Additionally one expect a specific a gravitational\nradiation pulse associated with the acceleration of the relativistic ejecta. I\nconsider here the implication of the observed rates of GRBs to the possibility\nof detection of a gravitational radiation signal associated with a GRB.\nUnfortunately I find that, with currently planned detectors it is impossible to\ndetect the direct gravitational radiation associated with the GRB. It is also\nquite unlikely to detect gravitational radiation associated with Collapsars.\nHowever, the detection of gravitational radiation from a neutron star merger\nassociated with a GRB is likely.", "score": 0.09642097353935242, "cosine": 0.82487952709198, "title_matches": "", "abs_matches": "pulse", "query_terms_used": "future, research, directions, motivated, discovery, giant, micro, pulses, large, amplitude, gaussian, component, vela, pulsar, pulse, profile", "classifier_functions": "Motivation, FutureWork", "retrieval_error": null, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-21T23:17:20.552395"}
