The spectra of the unlensed sources and Kurucz model spectra were\nused as templates to derive the radial velocities and the extinctions of the\nmicrolensed sources. It is shown that there is an extinction shift between the\nmicrolensed population and the non-microlensed population but there is no\napparent correlation between the extinction and the radial velocity. This\nextinction offset, in our best model, would imply that 65% of the events are\ncaused by self-lensing within the bulge.
