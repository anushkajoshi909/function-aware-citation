Maieron", "abstract": "After the EMC and subsequent experiments at CERN, SLAC and DESY on the deep\ninelastic scattering of polarized leptons on polarized nucleons, it is now\nestablished that the Q^2=0 value of the axial strange form factor of the\nnucleon, a quantity which is connected with the spin of the proton and is quite\nrelevant from the theoretical point of view, is relatively large.\n  In this review we consider different methods and observables that allow to\nobtain information on the strange axial and vector form factors of the nucleon\nat different values of Q^2. These methods are based on the investigation of the\nNeutral Current induced effects such as the P-odd asymmetry in the scattering\nof polarized electrons on protons and nuclei, the elastic neutrino\n(antineutrino) scattering on protons and the quasi-elastic neutrino\n(antineutrino) scattering on nuclei. We discuss in details the phenomenology of\nthese processes and the existing experimental data.", "score": 0.10137093812227249, "cosine": 0.8582610487937927, "title_matches": "", "abs_matches": "neutral, strange, vector", "query_terms_used": "observation, anti, flow, signal, neutral, strange, mesons, motivate, extend, understanding, medium, kaon, vector, potential, high, density, nuclear, matter", "classifier_functions": "Motivation, Extends", "retrieval_error": null, "retrieved_at": "2025-09-19T10:44:30.754803"}
