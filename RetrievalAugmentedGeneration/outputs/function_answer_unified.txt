The methods used in this study can be applied to future research on parity nonconserving electric dipole transition amplitudes by calculating these amplitudes to high accuracy using a hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach [Uses] (physics/0101044). This approach could be further developed in future work to compete with the accuracy of existing calculations, such as those for the Cs 6s-7s transition, if certain transition amplitudes are measured to high accuracy [FutureWork] (physics/0101044).
