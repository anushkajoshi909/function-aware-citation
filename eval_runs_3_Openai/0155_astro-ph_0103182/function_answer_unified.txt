The distinct types of hard steady states in GRS 1915+105, characterized by their X-ray spectral and timing properties, provide a foundation for understanding the underlying accretion flow [Background] (astro-ph/0103182). These states suggest potential avenues for future research by highlighting the possible differences in accretion flow structure due to the presence of relativistic outflow of matter [Background] (astro-ph/0103182).
