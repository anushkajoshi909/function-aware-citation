The analysis of the canonical structure for a gauge fixed PST bosonic five brane action provides a foundation for understanding the theory's stability properties and constraint algebra [Background] (hep-th/0103123). This groundwork lays the basis for potential future research in this area, such as exploring the implications of the master canonical action and BRST charge for theories with cosmological terms [FutureWork] (hep-th/0103123).
