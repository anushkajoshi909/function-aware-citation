Previous methods for simulating binary black hole systems had limitations in terms of accuracy, particularly in the nonlinear post-merger regime [Background] (gr-qc/0103011). The need to improve accuracy and control in computing gravitational waveforms motivated the development of new techniques, such as a partially first-order form of the characteristic formulation [Motivation] (gr-qc/0103011).
