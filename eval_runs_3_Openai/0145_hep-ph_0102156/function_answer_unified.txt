The RIMH models, which arise from SUSY SO(10) grand unified theories, compare favorably to other approaches in solving the SUSY flavor and CP problems by providing a decoupling solution [Compares] (hep-ph/0102156). They also provide background for understanding these problems, as they naturally reconcile naturalness with a decoupling solution within the context of SUSY SO(10) grand unified theories [Background] (hep-ph/0102156).
