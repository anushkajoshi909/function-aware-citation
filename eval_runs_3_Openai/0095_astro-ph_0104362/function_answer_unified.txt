The immense energy of gamma-ray bursts, exceeding that of supernovae by thousands of times, motivates further analysis to understand their unconventional energy mechanisms and extremely high conversion efficiency [Compares] (astro-ph/0101147). This comparison highlights the need for a deeper understanding of their energetic properties and central engines [Compares] (astro-ph/0101147).
