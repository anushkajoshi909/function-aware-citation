The current work's methods compare to those of previous redshift surveys [Compares] in terms of understanding large-scale structure, with ongoing surveys like the 2DF and SDSS improving upon earlier ones (astro-ph/0104418). The current work uses redshift surveys [Uses] to achieve unprecedented precision in understanding statistical clustering of low-redshift galaxies, similar to the 2DF and SDSS surveys (astro-ph/0104418).
