The current code's approach to solving the transfer of continuum and lines is compared to previous work in the field, such as the Accelerated Lambda Iteration method and two stream Eddington approximation used in astro-ph/0103317, which provides background information on radiative transfer and its recent developments [Compares] [Background] (astro-ph/0103317). Understanding this comparison requires knowledge of numerical radiative transfer and its applications in molecular astrophysics, as discussed in astro-ph/0102269.
