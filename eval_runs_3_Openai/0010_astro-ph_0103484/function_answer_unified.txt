The methods used in this study can inform future research on the X-ray luminosity of starburst galaxies by providing a better understanding of the contribution of OB star populations to the total X-ray emission [Uses] (astro-ph/0103484). This knowledge can guide future work in identifying the additional components that must be present in some starburst systems to explain the observed X-ray emission [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103484).
