Future research may investigate the effects of external shear and aligned discs on image positions and magnification cross sections in multiple lens systems [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103093). This could lead to improved lens modelling and a better understanding of statistical lensing, ultimately enhancing our ability to predict the maximum number of images produced by n-tuple lenses [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103093).
