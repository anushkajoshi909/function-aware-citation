The investigation of spatial variation in the cosmological constant is motivated by the possibility of differences in fundamental physical parameters across the universe [Motivation] (hep-ph/0101130). This idea is grounded in the understanding that the cosmological constant is highly sensitive to spatial variation, making it a powerful tool for indirect evidence against spatial gradients in other physical parameters [Background] (hep-ph/0101130).
