Research on UHE neutrino scattering onto relic cosmic neutrinos is motivated by the potential to overcome the GZK cut-off and uncover new information about neutrino masses and relic densities [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102426). Future work in this area may lead to a better understanding of neutrino properties and their role in the universe, with potential discoveries at energies near and above the GZK cut-off [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0102426).
