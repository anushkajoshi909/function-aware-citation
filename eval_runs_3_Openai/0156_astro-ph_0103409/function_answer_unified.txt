The current work extends previous studies on the stability of poloidal magnetic fields in accretion discs by numerically confirming the existence of the interchange instability and finding a global instability that transports angular momentum outward [Extends] (astro-ph/0103409). This instability is likely to be the main angular momentum transport mechanism in discs with a strong poloidal magnetic field, comparing with previous predictions from the shearing sheet model [Extends] (astro-ph/0103409).
