The discovery of a subparsec-scale dense plasma torus around an active galactic nucleus informs our understanding of the accretion process by suggesting a transition from radial accretion to rotational accretion around the nucleus [Background] (astro-ph/0104039). This finding also implies potential areas for future research, such as investigating the interplay between the plasma torus and the accretion process [Background] (astro-ph/0104039).
