The current understanding of supernova explosions and their interactions with the circumstellar medium is limited by several challenges, including the inability to infer the nature of the supernova and its progenitor star from observations [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101043). Further research is motivated to address these limitations, with potential future work focusing on multi-dimensional simulations and a better understanding of neutrino interactions to resolve the problem of spherical models not yielding explosions [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103015).
