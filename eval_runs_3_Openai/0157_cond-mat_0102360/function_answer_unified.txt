The limitation of the semiclassical model of the collective atomic recoil laser in describing quantum effects motivated its extension to include the quantum mechanical description of the center-of-mass motion of atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate [Motivation] (cond-mat/0102360). The extension uses methods from previous work, such as the Maxwell-Bloch equations for two momentum levels, to describe the behavior of the collective atomic recoil laser in different regimes [Uses] (cond-mat/0102360).
