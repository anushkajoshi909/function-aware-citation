The current work compares to previous studies by showing that any Hilbert function occurring among ACM schemes also occurs among glicci schemes, which is not the case when restricted to complete intersection links [Compares] (math/0103188). The investigation of the relationship between ACM and glicci schemes is motivated by the fact that the converse of the implication from glicci to ACM is an important open question [Motivation] (math/0103188).
