The work extends previous lattice estimates by introducing a new approach to expand gauge-invariant Wilson operators on lattice, overcoming shortages of former methods [Extends] (hep-lat/0104007). This development motivates the need for high-order perturbative calculations in the context of the operator product expansion, as it provides a suitable method for expanding any Wilson operators on lattice [Motivation] (hep-lat/0104007).
