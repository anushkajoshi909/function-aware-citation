The discovery of high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ sources motivates the study of chemically primitive galaxies in the early universe by providing insights into the evolution of their chemical properties [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104308). This discovery extends our understanding of galaxy formation by offering a direct constraint on models through the detection of extended Lyman alpha emission around young quasars [Extends] (astro-ph/0101174).
