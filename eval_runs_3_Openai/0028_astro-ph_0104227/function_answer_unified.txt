Future studies can utilize the current analysis of populous clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud to further understand its structure by building upon the conclusions drawn from the variation of cluster properties with position and line-of-sight depth [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0104227). The dataset and methods used in this work, such as analyzing age, metal abundance, and positional data, can be applied to larger datasets or combined with other studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the SMC's structure [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0104227).
