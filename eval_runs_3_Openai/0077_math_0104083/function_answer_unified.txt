The relationship between sparsity and statistical independence in stochastic processes is not yet fully understood, with existing knowledge suggesting that these two measures of efficiency can lead to different optimal bases [Background] (math/0104083). The study of a simple spike process reveals that the best basis for sparsity and statistical independence can differ, even leading to non-unique solutions for statistical independence [Background] (math/0104083).
