The current work's approach to simulating relativistic jets compares to previous models by highlighting the importance of magnetic field configurations and turbulence spectra in shaping cosmic ray spectra [Compares] (astro-ph/0104120). The differences found suggest potential areas of future research, including the investigation of particle acceleration at shear layers in relativistic jets [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0104120).
