The use of specific simulations in the study of disc-like objects is motivated by the need to accurately model the structural and dynamical properties of these objects, such as bulge and disc parameters and rotation curves [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102011). This is achieved through the implementation of a stellar formation algorithm that successfully forms compact bulges, stabilizing disc-like structures during their assembly [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102011).
