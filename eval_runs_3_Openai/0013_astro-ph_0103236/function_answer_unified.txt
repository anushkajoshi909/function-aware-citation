The development of the BMW catalogue motivates further research in X-ray source detection by providing a large sample of cluster candidates with good sky coverage and low flux limits [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101437). It extends existing work by introducing a wavelet transform detection algorithm that can accurately detect and characterize extended sources, allowing for the selection of complete samples of candidate clusters of galaxies [Extends] (astro-ph/0103236).
