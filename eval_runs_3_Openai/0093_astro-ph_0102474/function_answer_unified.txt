The framework of out of equilibrium field dynamics provides background information for understanding the evolution of highly excited quantum states by investigating inflation driven by these states [Background] (astro-ph/0102474). The motivation for this investigation lies in the potential of these quantum states to lead to two consecutive stages of inflation, providing a field theoretical justification for chaotic scenarios [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102474).
