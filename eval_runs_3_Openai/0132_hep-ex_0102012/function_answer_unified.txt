The PHOBOS experiment is one of four experiments studying Au-Au interactions at RHIC, using the PHOBOS detector to collect data on collisions of Au nuclei at center of mass energies of 56 and 130 AGeV [Background] (hep-ex/0102012). The experiment obtained its first physics results from data collected during the initial weeks after RHIC start-up, analyzing the pseudorapidity density of charged particles near midrapidity [Background] (hep-ex/0102012).
