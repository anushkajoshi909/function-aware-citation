The detection rates and characteristics of beamed Magnetar Flares are comparable to other gamma-ray bursts, with beamed sources potentially detectable out to redshift z ~ 0.1 at a rate of ~ 100 yr^-1 [Compares] (astro-ph/0103235). Future research could explore this relationship by investigating the positional coincidences of short, hard gamma-ray bursts with nearby galaxies and galaxy clusters [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103235).
