The current study's use of a 2-D hydro code allows for a detailed understanding of the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarfs by simulating multi-dimensional effects during the final hours prior to the explosion [Uses] (astro-ph/0104226). This approach provides new insights into the ignition process, convective flows, and flame propagation, which are essential for understanding the diversity in Type Ia Supernovae [Uses] (astro-ph/0104226).
