Understanding how X-ray photons interact with pixels provides background for determining the X-ray landing position by analyzing the charge cloud shape and event patterns [Background] (physics/0101052). This understanding is used to achieve subpixel resolution through methods such as selecting split pixel events, which can improve the spatial resolution of CCD detectors like the Chandra ACIS [Uses] (astro-ph/0101557).
