The capability of VLBI to image large fields-of-view with sub-mJy detection limits provides background for understanding cosmologically distant sources by allowing distinction between starburst and AGN activity [Background] (astro-ph/0102037). This capability motivates further study as it can reveal co-existing AGN and starburst activity in distant sources, such as the dusty starburst VLA J123642+621331 [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102037).
