Our current understanding of CP violation is based on the standard model, which describes its role in tree level processes and loop induced processes [Background] (hep-ph/0101259). Extensions of the standard model, such as supersymmetric extensions, build upon this understanding by introducing new sources of CP violation, including additional phases beyond the CKM phase, and providing a probe for new physics beyond the electroweak standard model [Extends] (hep-ph/0104027).
