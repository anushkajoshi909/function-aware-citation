The current work extends previous research on magnetospheric accretion by considering non-axisymmetric accretion models [Extends] (astro-ph/0102137), and uses the framework of magnetospheric accretion to interpret the observed features of RW Aur A, such as periodic modulations in spectral features and the lack of correlation between veiling and brightness [Uses] (astro-ph/0102137).
