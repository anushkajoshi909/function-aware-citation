Future studies of microlensing events could build on our current understanding of the optical depth and time-scale distribution in the context of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy by accounting for the contribution of Milky Way/Sagittarius events, which increases towards higher latitudes [Background] (astro-ph/0102013). These studies may also utilize systematic spectroscopic measurements to detect and characterize microlensing events involving sources in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy [Background] (astro-ph/0102013).
