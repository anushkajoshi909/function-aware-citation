The pulsation properties of SX Phe variables motivate further study of their evolutionary history in Galactic Globular Clusters and Local Group dwarf galaxies [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102029). They also extend our understanding of this history by providing a means to constrain the formation mechanisms of Blue Stragglers and identify the physical processes that trigger their creation [Extends] (astro-ph/0102029).
