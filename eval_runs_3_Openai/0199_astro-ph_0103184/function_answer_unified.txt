The discovery of non-thermal emission in dust-enshrouded Wolf-Rayet stars extends our understanding of dust production by suggesting that wind compression in a binary system is necessary for efficient dust production [Extends] (astro-ph/0103184). This finding motivates a re-evaluation of single-star and binary stellar evolution models, as the hypothesis that virtually all WC8-10 stars must be in binaries challenges current models [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103184).
