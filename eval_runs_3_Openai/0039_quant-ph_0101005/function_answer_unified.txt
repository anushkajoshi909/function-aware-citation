Current understanding of quantum communication and entanglement has limitations, as Holevo's theorem restricts the amount of classical information that can be communicated through quantum bits unless the parties are entangled [Background] (quant-ph/0101005). The potential of entanglement to enhance classical communication efficiency motivates further research, driven by the possibility of increasing information flux through communication channels using higher-dimensional entanglement [Motivation] (quant-ph/0104070).
