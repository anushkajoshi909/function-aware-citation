The proposed hybrid algorithm is studied in the context of on-line strategies for solving problems with hybrid algorithms, where a computer with limited memory areas can run basic algorithms to solve a problem Q [Background] (cs/0101028). The algorithm's efficiency is measured using competitive ratios, and it resolves an open question on searching with multiple robots, while also proving optimality for certain cases [Background] (cs/0101028).
