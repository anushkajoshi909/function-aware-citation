The current study's finding on the lower mass threshold for Hot Bottom Burning is at odds with existing stellar evolution models, which predict a higher threshold [Compares] (astro-ph/0103104). Future research could resolve the discrepancy between the observed and predicted luminosity of the carbon star by exploring the effects of thermal pulses and dredge-up processes on the evolution of intermediate-mass stars [Compares] (astro-ph/0103104).
