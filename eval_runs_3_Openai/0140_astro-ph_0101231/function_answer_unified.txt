The current work is set against the background of expected high-precision measurements of cosmic ray nuclei fluxes [Background] (astro-ph/0103043). It extends our understanding of cosmic ray propagation by proposing a test of the Cen A model using the Southern Auger Observatory, which may observe neutron events above $10^{20}$ eV [Extends] (astro-ph/0103043).
