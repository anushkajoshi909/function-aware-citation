The concept of homogeneity in cosmology is rooted in the idea that the initial density field is an almost-perfect random gaussian field [Background] (astro-ph/0101143). This understanding is used to inform the study of galaxy distribution through the application of statistical tools, such as the trispectrum, which can differentiate between gaussian and non-gaussian models [Uses] (astro-ph/0101143).
