The proposed model extends existing theories on blazar flares by incorporating additional radiation mechanisms, such as Comptonization of light from the broad emission line region and IR radiation from hot dust [Extends] (astro-ph/0101380). It also compares with observed flare behaviors, supporting the synchrotron-self Compton mechanism for X-ray production in certain objects [Extends] (astro-ph/0101380).
