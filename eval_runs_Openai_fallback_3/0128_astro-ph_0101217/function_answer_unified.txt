The problem of source crowding in astrometric measurements motivates the development of new methods, such as spectral decomposition of fringe patterns, to reduce positional errors [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101217). Future work can focus on further improving the accuracy of these measurements by applying these methods to various astrometric applications, including astrometric microlensing [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101217).
