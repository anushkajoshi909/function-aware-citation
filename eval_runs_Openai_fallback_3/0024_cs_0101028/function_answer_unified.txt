The proposed hybrid algorithm compares favorably to existing work in terms of efficiency, as it constructs an optimal deterministic hybrid algorithm and an efficient randomized hybrid algorithm [Compares] (cs/0101028). The background for this work involves studying on-line strategies for solving problems with hybrid algorithms, where a computer with disjoint memory areas runs basic algorithms to solve a problem in the least amount of time [Background] (cs/0101028).
