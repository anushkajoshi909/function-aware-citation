The enormous energy released by gamma-ray bursts, which is thousand times stronger than supernova explosions [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101147), motivates further analysis and comparison of their energetic properties, particularly when compared to other cosmic events like supernovae [Compares] (astro-ph/0101147).
