The calculation of multi-loop master integrals was motivated by the need for a new method to overcome the challenges of high-precision calculations [Motivation] (hep-ph/0102033). Understanding this approach requires background knowledge of numerical solutions of systems of difference equations and their application to Feynman integrals [Background] (hep-ph/0102033).
