Current understanding of quantum communication and entanglement has limitations, as Holevo's theorem restricts the amount of classical information that can be communicated through quantum bits unless the parties are entangled [Background] (quant-ph/0101005). The potential to enhance classical communication efficiency motivates further research into quantum communication and entanglement, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, which could increase information flux through communication channels [Motivation] (quant-ph/0104070).
