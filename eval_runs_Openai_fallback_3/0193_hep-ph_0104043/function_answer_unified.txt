The current work builds upon previous research, including a new theoretical framework for three neutrino mixing in matter [Background] (hep-ph/0104043), and is motivated by the need for a more accurate and efficient method to study three flavor neutrino oscillations in matter, driven by the complexities and characteristics unique to three flavor oscillations [Motivation] (hep-ph/0104043).
