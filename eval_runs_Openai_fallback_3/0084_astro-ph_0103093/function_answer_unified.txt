The method of multi-lens ray-tracing will be used to improve our understanding of strong gravitational lensing by multiple objects [Uses] (astro-ph/0103093). It will be important in future research for constraining lens models of individual systems and for statistical lensing [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103093).
