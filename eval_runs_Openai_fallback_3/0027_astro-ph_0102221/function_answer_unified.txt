The background information on the heating of X-Ray hot gas in galaxy groups suggests that internal heating by Type II supernovae is a preferred mechanism, as externally heated flows result in gas entropy that is too high [Background] (astro-ph/0101517). This understanding can inform future work on the topic, which may investigate the specifics of supernova heating and its effects on gas entropy [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0101517).
