The methods used to detect wind-blown bubbles, such as kinematic detection, are compared to model predictions, revealing a large discrepancy between observed and predicted stellar wind luminosity [Background] (astro-ph/0104420). The observed bubble dynamics differ significantly from model expectations, with expansion velocities comparable to the isothermal sound velocity in the HII regions [Background] (astro-ph/0104420).
