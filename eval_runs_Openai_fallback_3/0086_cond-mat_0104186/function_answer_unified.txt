The electronic properties of thick metallic silver films deposited on Si(111)-(7x7) substrates at room temperature [Compares] exhibit a sixfold symmetry and a three-dimensional character, which differs from the expected properties based on the background structure of Ag single crystals [Background] (cond-mat/0104186). The films' Fermi surface topology and dimensionality have been investigated using angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (cond-mat/0104186).
