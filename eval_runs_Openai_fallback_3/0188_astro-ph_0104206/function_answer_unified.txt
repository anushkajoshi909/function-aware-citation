The re-examination of global axisymmetric stability in the context of magnetorotational instabilities is motivated by the intense astrophysical interest in these instabilities and the need to prepare for an experimental study [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104206). The background information necessary to understand this re-examination includes the global axisymmetric stability of viscous, resistive, magnetized Couette flow, which is being re-examined with an emphasis on flows that would be hydrodynamically stable according to Rayleigh's criterion [Background] (astro-ph/0104206).
