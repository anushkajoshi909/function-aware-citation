The concept of discrete scalar fields compares to existing theories such as MOND by potentially putting it on a more solid physical basis through the introduction of an effective-acceleration scale [Compares] (hep-th/0103218). It utilizes Tsallis statistics, regarding it as proper for discrete-interaction systems, and reduces the validity of Botzmann statistics to idealized asymptotic states [Uses] (hep-th/0103218).
