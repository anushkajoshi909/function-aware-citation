The new calculation of photoionization of interstellar matter extends existing knowledge by providing a detailed model of the ionization and heating of the Complex of Local Interstellar Clouds [Extends] (astro-ph/0104234). The calculation is set against the background of the Complex of Local Interstellar Clouds, which is ionized by nearby hot stars and the diffuse emission of the Soft X-ray Background [Background] (astro-ph/0104234).
