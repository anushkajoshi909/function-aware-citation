The findings of this study on the coexistence of two scaling regimes in shear dominated flows [Compares] (nlin/0104042) differ from previous work in that they provide evidence of the coexistence of the two regimes, whereas previous data only showed one regime at a time. This study suggests future research directions, such as investigating the implications of turbulent dissipation for galaxy formation and evolution [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0101397).
