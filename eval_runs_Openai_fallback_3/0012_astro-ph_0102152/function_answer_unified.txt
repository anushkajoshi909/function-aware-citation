The comparison between big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background observations [Compares] (astro-ph/0102152) reveals a potential discrepancy in the measured baryon abundance, which is set against the background understanding of the universe's evolution [Background] (astro-ph/0102152). This background understanding is based on the general agreement among various measurements of the baryon density at different ages of the universe (astro-ph/0102152).
