The proposal by Fuller & Shi provides background for the generation of gravitational waves during the formation of supermassive black holes by suggesting that the collapse of supermassive objects could be a source of these waves [Background] (astro-ph/0101022). The model is used to argue for the strong generation of gravitational waves, which could be detected by the Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA) and could occur with a small time difference from the detection of gamma-ray bursts [Uses] (astro-ph/0101022).
