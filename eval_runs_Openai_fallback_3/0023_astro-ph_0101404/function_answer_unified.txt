The limitations of the current study on the Tully-Fisher relation and dark matter halos motivate further research [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102025). Future work could involve using the Tully-Fisher relation at high redshift to constrain galaxy-formation models and break parameter degeneracies [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0102025).
