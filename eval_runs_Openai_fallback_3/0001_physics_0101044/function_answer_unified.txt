The methods used in this study can be applied to future research on parity nonconserving electric dipole transition amplitudes by utilizing a hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach to calculate PNC s-d amplitudes to high accuracy [Uses] (physics/0101044). This approach can be further developed in future work to compete with the accuracy of Cs 6s-7s calculations if p_{1/2}-d_{3/2} E1 amplitudes are measured to high accuracy [FutureWork] (physics/0101044).
