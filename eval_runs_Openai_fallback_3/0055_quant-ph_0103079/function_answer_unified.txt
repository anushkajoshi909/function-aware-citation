The Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics provides background [Background] for understanding correlations between spatially-separated systems by using the Heisenberg picture to explain how measurement interactions lead to local copies of systems and observers (quant-ph/0103079). This interpretation uses [Uses] the Heisenberg picture to provide a local explanation for correlations, replacing nonlocality with a problem of proliferating labels as systems and observers interact with new objects and instruments (quant-ph/0103079).
