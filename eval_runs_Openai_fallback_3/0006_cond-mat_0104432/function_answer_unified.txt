Future research could be motivated by the current study's inability to distinguish between vertical and horizontal line nodes in spin-triplet superconducting states [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104432). This limitation suggests that further investigation is needed to develop methods that can differentiate between these two pairing models [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104432).
