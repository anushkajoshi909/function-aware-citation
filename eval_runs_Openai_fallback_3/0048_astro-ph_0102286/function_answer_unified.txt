Future studies can extend the current classification schemes of early-type galaxies by incorporating the newly discovered intermediate class of galaxies, which have central cusp slopes and absolute magnitudes intermediate between those of core and power-law galaxies [Extends] (astro-ph/0102286). This extension is necessary because the existing schemes, such as classification based on central cusp slope, may not adequately represent galaxies with smoothly changing luminosity profiles [Extends] (astro-ph/0102286).
