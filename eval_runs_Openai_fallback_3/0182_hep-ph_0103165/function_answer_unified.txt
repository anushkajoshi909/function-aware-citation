Future research may utilize the developed techniques for analyzing SO(2N) invariant couplings to investigate the role of large tensor representations in generating quark lepton textures [FutureWork] (hep-ph/0103165). This could lead to a deeper understanding of proton decay lifetime and neutrino mass textures, potentially enhancing our knowledge of these phenomena [FutureWork] (hep-ph/0103165).
