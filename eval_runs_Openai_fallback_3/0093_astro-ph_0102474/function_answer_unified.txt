The framework of out of equilibrium field dynamics provides background information for understanding the evolution of highly excited quantum states by investigating inflation driven by these states [Background] (astro-ph/0102474). The motivation for this investigation is to study the self-consistent evolution of these quantum states and the scale factor, which leads to two consecutive stages of inflation [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102474).
