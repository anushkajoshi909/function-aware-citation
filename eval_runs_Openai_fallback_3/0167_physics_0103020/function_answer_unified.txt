The current work reexamines the understanding of electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves, revealing a more complex structure with both density enhancements and depletions, and a net zero total charge [Background] (physics/0103020). This reexamination was motivated by limitations in previous thoughts, which incorrectly assumed only density depletions and required thermal screening, restricting the size of these waves to be greater than the Debye length [Background] (physics/0103020).
