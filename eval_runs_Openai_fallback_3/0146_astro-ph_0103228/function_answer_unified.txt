The current work compares to previous studies on high-redshift quasars by estimating a larger sample of quasars, around 9100, and setting an upper limit on the lensing fraction [Compares] (astro-ph/0101230). It extends previous research by using a novel procedure to exhaustively search for lensed objects without requiring prior identification of quasars, enabling characterization of the quasar population and constraints on cluster mass properties [Extends] (astro-ph/0101230).
