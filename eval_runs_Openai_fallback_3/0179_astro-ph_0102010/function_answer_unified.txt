The current work extends previous research on baryon fraction in clusters by critically examining the baryon distribution and gas fraction profiles [Extends] (astro-ph/0102010), and it uses the baryon fraction in clusters, combined with constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis, to inform the estimation of the cosmological density parameter $\Omega_0$ [Uses] (astro-ph/0102010).
