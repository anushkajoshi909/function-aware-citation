The current understanding of Population III star formation can be further developed through numerical simulations that investigate the collapse and fragmentation of primordial gas [Extends] (astro-ph/0103382). Future research is needed to address the new questions raised by these simulations and better constrain the initial mass function of these stars [FutureWork] (astro-ph/0103382).
