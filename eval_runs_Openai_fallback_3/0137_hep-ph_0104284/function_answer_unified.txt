Understanding the Higgs search and its relation to B physics in Run II at the Tevatron provides necessary background information [Background] (hep-ex/0101055). The motivation for calculating Higgs-boson contributions to rare B decays stems from the potential to improve knowledge of CP violation in the B system through the study of B mixing and rare decays [Motivation] (hep-ex/0101055).
