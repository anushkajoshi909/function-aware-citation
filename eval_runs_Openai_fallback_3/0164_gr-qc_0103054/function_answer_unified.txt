The late-time behavior of a dynamically perturbed rapidly rotating black hole provides background for understanding its implications, as it exhibits a unique oscillating "tail" with an amplitude that decays as 1/t at late times [Background] (gr-qc/0103054). This understanding suggests areas for future research on gravitational-wave signals, including the construction of theoretical templates from linear combinations of many modes [FutureWork] (gr-qc/0103054).
