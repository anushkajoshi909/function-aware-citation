The background information that there are infinitely many primes and that the product of the first k primes has neighbors with all prime divisors beyond p_k [Background] (math/0103091) motivates the current work on Goldbach's Conjecture, as failure of the conjecture contradicts the proven "Goldbach for Residues" mod m_k, thereby driving research forward [Motivation] (math/0103091).
