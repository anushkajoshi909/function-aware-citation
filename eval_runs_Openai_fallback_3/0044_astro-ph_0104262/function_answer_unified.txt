The effects of irradiation on planetary atmospheres, as described in the background of this study [Background] (astro-ph/0104262), are compared to other models in terms of the impact of dust clouds on atmospheric structure and emergent spectrum [Compares] (astro-ph/0104262). The study's models indicate that the presence or absence of dust clouds significantly alters the atmospheric structure and emergent spectrum, resulting in different brightness ratios [Compares] (astro-ph/0104262).
