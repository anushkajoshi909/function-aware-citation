Future studies can extend the current work's method of analyzing galaxy correlation functions by applying it to different galaxy samples and cosmological models to better understand the implications of the measured pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion on galaxy biasing [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104023). This can involve constructing mock samples for various cold dark matter models and applying different biasing schemes to reproduce the observational data [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104023).
