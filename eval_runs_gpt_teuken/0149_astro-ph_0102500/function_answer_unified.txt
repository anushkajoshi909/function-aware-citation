The analysis of the X-ray source is motivated by the desire to understand the properties of Galactic black holes and the physics of accretion flows [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103431). The background for this analysis is provided by recent X-ray timing and spectral observations of black hole binaries, which have redefined methods for investigating these properties [Background] (astro-ph/0103431).
