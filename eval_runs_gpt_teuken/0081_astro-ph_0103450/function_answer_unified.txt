The current work extends previous methods for determining metallicity and age in galaxies by exploring the use of the rest-frame near-UV spectral region to lift the degeneracy between age and metallicity [Background] (astro-ph/0103450). This extension is motivated by the limitation of previous work in accurately determining ages and metallicities, particularly in high-redshift galaxies, where the age-metallicity degeneracy is a significant problem [Background] (astro-ph/0103450).
