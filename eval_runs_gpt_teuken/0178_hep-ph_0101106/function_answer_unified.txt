The current work on CP-violating phases can be extended by exploring the influence of new physics on CP-violating observables and developing a systematic method to include new physics [Motivation] (hep-ph/0101259). This can lead to future research directions that check the validity of the standard model in loop-induced processes and determine its parameters [Motivation] (hep-ph/0101259).
