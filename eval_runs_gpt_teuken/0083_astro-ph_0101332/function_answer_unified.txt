The study of the coupled evolution of a two giant planet system is motivated by the possibility of resonance trapping and reversing type II migration [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101332). This phenomenon differs from the one planet case in terms of migration, as the two planet system can experience outwards migration due to a positive differential Lindblad torque [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101332).
