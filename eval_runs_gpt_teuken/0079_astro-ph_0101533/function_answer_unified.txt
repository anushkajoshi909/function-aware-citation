The current use of Imaging Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes to detect gamma rays from astrophysical objects, such as the Crab Nebula and Active Galaxies, informs future work by providing a test beam and revealing particle acceleration mechanisms [Background] (astro-ph/0101533). The detection of gamma rays from these objects motivates future research, as it may lead to the discovery of new phenomena, such as neutralino annihilation or the evaporation of primordial black holes [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101533).
