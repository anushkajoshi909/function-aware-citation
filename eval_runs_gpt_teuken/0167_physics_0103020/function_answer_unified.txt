The current work's understanding of electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal solitary waves differs from previous thoughts in that it reveals a net balance of negative charge from trapped electrons and positive charge from passing electrons, and a zero total charge [Background] (physics/0103020). This reexamination was motivated by the limitation of previous work that incorrectly assumed only density depletion and required thermal screening, restricting the size of BGK EHs [Motivation] (physics/0103020).
