The method of polarisation conversion of electromagnetic waves in 2D electron systems has a background in theoretical studies of cyclotron-polaritons excitation under cyclotron resonance conditions [Background] (cond-mat/0101072). This method can be used in future research for polarisation spectroscopy applications due to its high polarisation conversion efficiency, motivating further exploration of its potential [Motivation] (cond-mat/0101072).
