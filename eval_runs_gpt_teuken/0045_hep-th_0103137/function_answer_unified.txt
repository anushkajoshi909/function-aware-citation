The geometric approach to the standard model using Clifford algebra Cl_7 provides a foundation for understanding the symmetries and structures of particle physics by describing the gauge group in terms of spinor transformations [Background] (hep-th/0103137). This approach motivates further research into the model's potential to unify Poincare and isotopic symmetries, and to explain the origins of charge assignments and the Higgs field [Motivation] (hep-th/0103137).
