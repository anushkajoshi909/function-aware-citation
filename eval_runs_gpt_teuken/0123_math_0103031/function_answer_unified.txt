The unification of independence achieved through the hierarchy of freeness provides a foundation for noncommutative probability theories [Background] (math/0103031). Further development of this approach is motivated by its potential to address limitations in current theories by extending the hierarchy to more general cases, such as conditionally free products of states [Motivation] (math/0103031).
