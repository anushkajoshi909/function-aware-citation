The current work's method of deriving the color-magnitude relation is based on color measurements within the effective radius of galaxies, which reduces bias introduced by radial color gradients [Background] (astro-ph/0102090). This approach is motivated by the need to improve upon traditional methods that use fixed apertures, as it provides a more accurate representation of the color-magnitude relation using a sample of 48 giant early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102090).
