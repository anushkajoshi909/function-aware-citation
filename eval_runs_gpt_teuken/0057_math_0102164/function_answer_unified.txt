The current work extends previous research on quantum field theories by providing a reformulation of fermionic QFT in electromagnetic backgrounds using methods analogous to conventional multiparticle quantum mechanics [Background] (hep-th/0103228). This extension was motivated by limitations in earlier studies, such as the need for a complete set of orthonormal modes and the dependence on choice of coordinates or gauge, which are addressed by the new approach [Motivation] (hep-th/0103228).
