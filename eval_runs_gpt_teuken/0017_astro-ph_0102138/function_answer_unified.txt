The limitations of current cosmological parameter constraints could motivate future research in areas such as cosmology and theoretical physics [Background] (hep-ph/0103349). This research may explore new implications and relations amongst standard model couplings, including gravitational ones, to improve our understanding of the universe [Background] (hep-ph/0103349).
