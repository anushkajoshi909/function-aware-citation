The proposed model of stellar system formation, which suggests that gas rich sub-galactic halos are compressed by an inward convergent shock caused by cosmological reionization, resulting in the formation of self-gravitating baryonic systems that match the observed properties of halo globular clusters [Background] (astro-ph/0101197), motivates further research to validate this comparison by exploring the predicted correlations between velocity dispersion, luminosity, and metallicity, and the expected trend of specific frequency with galaxy type [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101197).
