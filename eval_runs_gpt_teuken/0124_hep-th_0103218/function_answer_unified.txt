The concept of discrete scalar fields builds upon existing theories such as MOND and Tsallis statistics by providing a potential physical basis for MOND through the introduction of an effective-acceleration scale and utilizing Tsallis statistics as a proper framework for discrete-interaction systems [Background] (hep-th/0103218). This comparison is motivated by the possibility of discrete-field manifestations being observed in phenomena such as flat rotation curves of galaxies, which may validate the use of discrete scalar fields in understanding these observations [Motivation] (hep-th/0103218).
