The discovery of non-thermal emission in dust-enshrouded Wolf-Rayet stars provides background information on the role of colliding winds in dust production [Background] (astro-ph/0103184). This finding motivates a re-evaluation of single-star and binary stellar evolution models, as it suggests that wind compression in a binary system is necessary for efficient dust production, implying that most dusty WC8-10 stars must be in binaries [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103184).
