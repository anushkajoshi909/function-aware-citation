The pulsation properties of SX Phe variables provide a background for understanding their evolutionary history in Galactic Globular Clusters and Local Group dwarf galaxies, as they are affected by metal content and helium envelope content [Background] (astro-ph/0102029). The study of these properties motivates further research into the evolutionary history of Blue Stragglers, as they can be used to constrain their formation mechanisms [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102029).
