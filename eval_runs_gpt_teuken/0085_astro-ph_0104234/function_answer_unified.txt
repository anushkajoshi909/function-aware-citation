The new calculation of photoionization of interstellar matter builds upon existing knowledge of the Complex of Local Interstellar Clouds by incorporating directly observed radiation sources and modeling unobserved EUV emission [Background] (astro-ph/0104234). This approach improves agreement with various observations, including pickup ion results and interstellar absorption line data [Background] (astro-ph/0104234).
