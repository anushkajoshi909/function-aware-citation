The analysis of the absorption feature in GRB 990705 provides insight into the properties of the absorbing material, which is likely moderately clumped and not very close to the burster [Background] (astro-ph/0104062). This understanding motivates further research on the impact of supernova remnants on afterglow generation, as the presence of a young remnant surrounding the burst site could affect the standard power-law flux decay [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104062).
