The investigation of MgB$_2$ is motivated by its unique electronic properties, which set it apart from other diborides due to strong charge anisotropy at the B site defined by valence electrons [Motivation] (cond-mat/0104346). Its electronic properties, including a prominent van Hove peak and sensitivity to volume, are also of interest as they suggest possibilities for enhancing superconducting transition temperatures through doping or pressure [Background] (cond-mat/0104098).
