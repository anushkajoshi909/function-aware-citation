The development of the coupled microwave-cavity system provides background for future improvements in axion detection by demonstrating the feasibility of a tunable cavity resonant frequency and low-temperature operation [Background] (physics/0101028). This setup allows for the reduction of background thermal blackbody-photons and paves the way for potential enhancements in axion detection sensitivity [Background] (physics/0101028).
