The dynamic and adaptive method for domain decomposition in the parallel tree-code has its background in astrophysics simulations, where it is used to efficiently simulate self-gravitating systems [Background] (astro-ph/0104152). The motivation behind this method is to achieve low computational costs by minimizing parallelization overhead, which is less than 4% of the total CPU-time, allowing for high computation speed and good load balancing [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104152).
