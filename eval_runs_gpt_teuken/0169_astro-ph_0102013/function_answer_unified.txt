Future studies of microlensing events can build on our current understanding of the optical depth and time-scale distribution of these events in the context of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy by considering the galaxy's presence in current microlensing surveys and its potential to bias optical depth maps [Background] (astro-ph/0102013). This understanding can motivate further research, such as systematic spectroscopic measurements, to detect and analyze microlensing events involving the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and reduce degeneracy on lens mass [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102013).
