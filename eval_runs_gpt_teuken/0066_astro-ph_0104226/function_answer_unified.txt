The current study's use of a 2-D hydro code allows for a detailed examination of multi-dimensional effects during the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarfs, providing insights into the ignition process and flame propagation [Background] (astro-ph/0104226). This approach differs from other methods by highlighting the importance of convective flows and the pre-conditioning of the progenitor in understanding the explosion [Background] (astro-ph/0104226).
