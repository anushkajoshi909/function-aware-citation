The methods used to detect wind-blown bubbles involve kinematic detection, as their expansion velocities are comparable to the isothermal sound velocity in HII regions [Background] (astro-ph/0104420). The motivation for this research stems from the rare observation of ring nebulae around main-sequence O stars, prompting a search for wind-blown bubbles around these stars to compare with model predictions [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104420).
