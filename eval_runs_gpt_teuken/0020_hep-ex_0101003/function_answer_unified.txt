Measuring muon polarization in kaon decay processes provides valuable information on CP violation, the quark mixing matrix, and new physics [Background] (hep-ex/0101003). The potential to probe new physics and obtain clean measurements of CKM parameters motivates future research in this area, particularly in studying muon polarization out of the decay plane in KMU3 and radiative KMU2 decays [Motivation] (hep-ex/0101003).
