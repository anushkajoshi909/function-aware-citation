The mid-infrared spectral energy distribution of Mrk 279 exhibits a strong power law continuum and weak PAH emission features, with a mid-IR bump extending from 2 to 15-20 micron, consistent with thermal emission from dust grains [Background] (astro-ph/0102356). This background information on Mrk 279's emission features can be used to compare its spectral energy distribution to other Seyfert galaxies [Background] (astro-ph/0102356).
