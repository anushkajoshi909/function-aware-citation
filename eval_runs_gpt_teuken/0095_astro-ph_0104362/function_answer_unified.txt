The intense energy release and unconventional mechanisms of gamma-ray bursts, which are the most energetic events known, are not yet fully understood [Background] (astro-ph/0101147). This lack of understanding motivates further analysis and comparison of their energetic properties to uncover the underlying central engines and energy mechanisms [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101147).
