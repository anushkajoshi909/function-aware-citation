The analysis of the canonical structure for a gauge fixed PST bosonic five brane action provides a foundation for understanding the theory's properties, such as its stability and constraints [Background] (hep-th/0103123). This groundwork lays the basis for potential future research in the area, motivating further investigation into the theory's behavior and applications [Motivation] (hep-th/0103123).
