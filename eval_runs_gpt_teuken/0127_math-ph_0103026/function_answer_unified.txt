Previous studies on non-linear parabolic equations, such as those in math-ph/0103026, provide background [Background] on the stability of stationary solutions in fluid dynamics by analyzing the spectrum of the generator of time-evolution. The fact that the stability of the stationary state is not guaranteed, as the generator is not a sectorial operator [Motivation] (math-ph/0103026).
