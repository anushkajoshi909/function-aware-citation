The proposed model extends existing theories on blazar flares by incorporating additional radiation mechanisms, such as Comptonization of light from the broad emission line region and IR radiation from hot dust [Background] (astro-ph/0101380). The motivation behind this model is to better understand the observed flare behaviors and to explain the 'cooling' nature of the MeV peak in blazars by comparing flares produced in different energy bands [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101380).
