The current model of electromagnetic structure black holes can be extended to study longer bursts with baryonic matter by exploring the conditions exterior to microscopic black holes [Background] (astro-ph/0101515). This extension is motivated by the potential to describe the highest temperatures in the universe and detect microscopic black holes, presenting a great theoretical and detection challenge [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101515).
