The current work builds upon previous studies on high-redshift quasars by utilizing a large sample of approximately 9100 quasars [Background] (astro-ph/0101230), and is motivated by the need to understand the statistics of gravitationally lensed quasars at large image separations, which can provide insights into the mass properties of galaxy clusters [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101230).
