The framework of out of equilibrium field dynamics provides background information for understanding the evolution of highly excited quantum states by investigating inflation driven by these states [Background] (astro-ph/0102474). This framework studies the self-consistent evolution of quantum states and the scale factor, leading to a deeper understanding of the evolution of these states [Background] (astro-ph/0102474).
