The current work extends previous studies by investigating the relationship between ACM and glicci schemes [Motivation], and it is motivated by the fact that the converse of the implication that glicci schemes are ACM is an important open question (math/0103188). The investigation of this relationship is driven by the goal of understanding the conditions under which ACM schemes are equivalent to glicci schemes [Motivation] (math/0103188).
