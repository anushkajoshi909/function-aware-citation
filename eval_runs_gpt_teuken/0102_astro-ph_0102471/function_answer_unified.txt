The inability to detect predicted TeV gamma-ray flux from supernova remnants [Background] (astro-ph/0101175) motivates further research due to limitations in understanding the acceleration of cosmic rays and the resulting gamma-ray emission [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101175). This suggests potential areas for future work in developing more realistic analytical models to obtain reliable predictions [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101175).
