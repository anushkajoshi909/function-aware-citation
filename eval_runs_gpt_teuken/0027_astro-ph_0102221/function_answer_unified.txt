The heating of X-Ray hot gas in galaxy groups is influenced by external and internal heating processes, with internal heating by Type II supernovae being preferred over external heating [Background] (astro-ph/0101517). This background information can inform future work by considering the effects of internal heating mechanisms on the entropy and X-ray luminosity of galaxy groups [Background] (astro-ph/0101517).
