The concept of homogeneity in cosmology is informed by previous results, such as the use of the trispectrum to differentiate between gaussian and non-gaussian models [Background] (astro-ph/0101143), and is motivated by the need to understand the large-scale distribution of galaxies and the possibility that it follows a fractal pattern [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104181). The understanding of galaxy distribution is further complicated by the distinction between local and average relativistic densities, which can display asymptotically opposite behaviors [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104181).
