The extension of the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm to include surface fields relates to the use of power laws predicted by Fisher and Nakanishi [Background] as it allows for a Monte Carlo study of the capillary condensation critical point, yielding results consistent with these power laws (cond-mat/0101198). The study confirms the predicted power laws for the critical temperature and field, which are proportional to certain exponents of the lattice spacing (cond-mat/0101198).
