Future experiments can extend the current analysis of new-physics effects in the $B o J/\psi K$ system by constraining models of new physics using experimental results on various observables [Background] (hep-ph/0103299). This can be achieved by analytically and numerically studying the ratio and phase difference between new physics and Standard Model contributions to the mixing amplitude of the neutral $B$ system [Background] (hep-ph/0103299).
