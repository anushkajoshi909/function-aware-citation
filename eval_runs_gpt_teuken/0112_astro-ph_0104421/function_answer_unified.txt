The study of the 5 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation in GRS 1739-278 provides background [Background] on low-frequency QPOs in black-hole candidates, showing a QPO with energy-dependent amplitude and lags (astro-ph/0104421). This research motivates further investigation [Motivation] into the properties of low-frequency QPOs in black-hole candidates, as the findings suggest a physical relationship between the 5 Hz QPO and other observed features (astro-ph/0104421).
