The limitations of current methods for solving high-dimensional Ising models motivate future research in developing more effective approaches to address the "phase interference" effect and algebraic recursive series solutions [Motivation] (hep-th/0104214). This motivation may lead to exploring new frameworks, such as high-dimensional Bosonization, to overcome these limitations [Motivation] (hep-th/0104214).
