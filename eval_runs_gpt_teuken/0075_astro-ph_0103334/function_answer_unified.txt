The investigation of magnetic field fluctuations in the NGC 7538 region is motivated by the desire to understand the role of magnetic fields in guiding molecular outflows and the differences in evolutionary stages of cores [Motivation] (astro-ph/0103334). The observations of polarization are used to understand these fluctuations, providing insight into the magnetic field structure and its impact on core evolution, with the background being the distinct polarization patterns and degrees of polarization in the IRS 1(SMM) and IRS 11(SMM) cores [Background] (astro-ph/0103334).
