The Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics uses the Heisenberg picture to provide background for understanding correlations between spatially-separated quantum systems by offering a local explanation for these correlations [Background] (quant-ph/0103079). This interpretation leads to many local copies of systems and observers, with measurement interactions inducing transformations that "label" each copy and ensure correct interactions between them [Background] (quant-ph/0103079).
