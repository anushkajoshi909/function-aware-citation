The spectroscopic study of microlensed sources is motivated by the opportunity to study the kinematics of the Galactic bulge and the effects of extinction on these sources [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101092). It uses datasets from spectrographic observations, such as those from the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph, to derive radial velocities and extinctions of the microlensed sources (astro-ph/0101092).
