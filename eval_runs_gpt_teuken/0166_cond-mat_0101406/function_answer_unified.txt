The current work's use of the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism to solve the random heteropolymer model [Background] (cond-mat/0101406) allows for a non-perturbative solution employing a Gaussian variational approach, which differs from other approaches in its ability to derive equations of motion for correlation and response functions. This approach enables the extraction of order parameters and the construction of a dynamical phase diagram [Background] (cond-mat/0101406).
