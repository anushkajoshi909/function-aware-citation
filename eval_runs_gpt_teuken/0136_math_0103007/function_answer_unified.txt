The development of lossy data compression algorithms in the paper builds upon previous work by Wyner and Ziv in 1989 and utilizes methods from rate-distortion theory and pattern-matching algorithms [Background] (math/0103007). The paper also extends previous results by applying the lossy Asymptotic Equipartition Property to prove strengthened versions of Shannon's source coding theorem and universal coding theorems [Extends] (math/0103007).
