The limitation of having only one old orbit solution for UX Ari provides background [Background] for the current work, which aims to improve the orbit using new radial velocity measurements (astro-ph/0102405). This limitation motivates the current research [Motivation] to refine the orbit and explore new areas, such as the discovery of a triple system, with more accurate data (astro-ph/0102405).
