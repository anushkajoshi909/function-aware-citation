Understanding how X-ray photons interact with pixels provides background for determining the X-ray landing position by analyzing the charge cloud shape and event patterns [Background] (physics/0101052). The motivation for achieving subpixel resolution lies in improving the spatial resolution of X-ray detectors, such as the Chandra ACIS, by selecting specific events like corner events to enhance image quality [Motivation] (astro-ph/0101557).
