The current understanding of ionization properties in Damped Ly alpha systems is limited by the potential effects of ionization corrections on abundance measurements [Background] (astro-ph/0104298). Further research is motivated by the need to accurately determine these corrections and understand the role of gas with intermediate ionization states [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104298).
