The proposed hybrid algorithm is set against the background of existing on-line strategies for solving problems with hybrid algorithms, where the goal is to solve a problem in the least amount of time [Background] (cs/0101028). The motivation for this work stems from the need to resolve open questions on searching with multiple robots and settle conjectures on the optimality of randomized algorithms [Motivation] (cs/0101028).
