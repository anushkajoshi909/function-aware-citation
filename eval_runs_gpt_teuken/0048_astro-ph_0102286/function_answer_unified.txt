Future studies can extend current classification schemes of early-type galaxies by accounting for the newly discovered intermediate class of galaxies, driven by the need to better understand the formation and evolution of these galaxies [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104404). This extension is necessary due to the remaining systematic uncertainties in determining the star formation epochs of early-type galaxies [Motivation] (astro-ph/0104404).
