Previous studies of star formation rates in Lyman break galaxies had limitations, including uncertainties in calibrations and potential differential extinction between rest-frame optical and UV [Background] (astro-ph/0102456), which motivated the current work to re-examine these rates and compare them to previous expectations, driven by the desire to better understand the star formation processes in these galaxies [Motivation] (astro-ph/0102456).
