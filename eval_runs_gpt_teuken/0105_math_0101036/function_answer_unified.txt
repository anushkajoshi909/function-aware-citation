Geometrical stability theory provides background for the study of homogeneous models by offering a set of model-theoretic tools that lead to structural results on models of a simple first-order theory [Background] (math/0101036). The theory is motivated by the desire to extend its application to non-saturated structures, such as homogeneous models with noncompact Stone topologies, where the concept of canonical base also exists [Motivation] (math/0101036).
