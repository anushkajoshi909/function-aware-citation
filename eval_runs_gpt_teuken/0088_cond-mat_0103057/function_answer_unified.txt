Future research can utilize the extended Emery model to improve understanding of copper-oxide layered materials by analyzing the three-band structure and its parameters, such as Cu-O site energy splitting and O-O second neighbor hopping [Background] (cond-mat/0103057). This analysis can help relate band touching and van Hove singularities to the appearance of superconducting properties [Background] (cond-mat/0103057).
