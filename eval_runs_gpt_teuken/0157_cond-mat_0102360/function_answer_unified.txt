The limitation of the semiclassical model of the collective atomic recoil laser in describing quantum effects motivated its extension to include the quantum mechanical description of the center-of-mass motion of atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate [Motivation] (cond-mat/0102360). This extension builds on previous work by using the Maxwell-Bloch equations for two momentum levels when the average atomic momentum is less than the recoil momentum [Background] (cond-mat/0102360).
